#Chatbot Documentation
##Overview
This project is a chatbot designed to provide users with relevant information from platform-specific documentation. The chatbot processes user queries and provides answers using:

Fuzzy string matching to find the most relevant sentences from the documentation.
Natural language processing (NLP) to break down and understand the user’s query.
The chatbot is currently capable of answering queries related to the following platforms:

Segment
mParticle
Lytics
Zeotap
The goal is to provide quick and accurate responses to questions by leveraging platform-specific documentation stored in JSON files.

##Features
Platform Detection: Automatically identifies which platform the user is referring to and searches the corresponding documentation.
Fuzzy String Matching: Uses the FuzzyWuzzy library to find the most relevant match for user queries.
JSON-based Data: The documentation for each platform is stored in separate JSON files, making it easy to manage and update.
Query Tokenization: Breaks down user input into tokens for better search and match accuracy.
Top 3 Results: Displays the top 3 most relevant answers based on fuzzy match scores.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
N/A: The chatbot is a backend Python application without a frontend.
Backend:
Python: Main programming language for implementing the logic.
NLTK: Used for processing and tokenizing user input.
FuzzyWuzzy: Library for fuzzy string matching to find the closest documentation sentences.
JSON: Stores documentation for different platforms.

##Data Structures Used
JSON (File Format):
Platform Documentation: Each platform’s documentation is stored in a separate JSON file. These files contain key information and sections specific to each platform.
Lists (Python):
Documentation Sentences: Each platform’s documentation is represented as a list of sentences, which the chatbot searches through to find relevant responses.
Dictionaries (Python):
Scores: A dictionary stores the match score for each sentence, helping rank the relevance of results.
Sets (Python):
Tokenized Words: Stores tokenized words from the user’s query, ensuring uniqueness for better processing and matching.
##Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include:

nginx
Copy
Edit
nltk
fuzzywuzzy
python-Levenshtein
3. Run the Chatbot
After installing the dependencies, you can start the chatbot by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python chatbot.py
Once the script is running, you will be able to enter a query and get a response from the chatbot.

##Future Enhancements
Add More Platforms: Extend the chatbot to support additional platforms and their documentation.
Improve Matching Algorithm: Enhance fuzzy string matching for more accurate results.
Persistent Storage: Save and log user queries and responses for further analysis.
Web Interface: Create a frontend UI using Flask or React for better user interaction.
User Authentication: Implement authentication for personalized responses or saved queries.
