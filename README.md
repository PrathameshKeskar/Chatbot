Chatbot Documentation
Overview
This project is a chatbot designed to answer questions related to various platforms such as Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot processes user queries and returns the most relevant information from platform-specific documentation stored in JSON files. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and fuzzy string matching to provide the best possible responses.

Key features:

Platform Detection: Identifies which platform the user is referring to (e.g., Segment, mParticle, etc.).
Fuzzy Matching: Uses fuzzy string matching to find the closest sentences from documentation that match the user's query.
Query Tokenization: Breaks down the userâ€™s input into tokens for better processing and matching.
The chatbot aims to simplify the process of querying platform-specific documentation and provide relevant, context-based answers.

Tech Stack
Frontend:
N/A: The project currently operates as a backend Python script. No frontend is included in this version.
Backend:
Python: The core logic for the chatbot, including platform detection, query processing, and fuzzy matching.
NLTK: Used for tokenizing user input and processing natural language queries.
FuzzyWuzzy: Used for fuzzy string matching to find the most relevant answers from documentation.
JSON: Stores platform-specific documentation that the chatbot queries for answers.

Data Structures Used
Lists (Python):
Documentation Sentences: Each platformâ€™s documentation is stored as a list of sentences. The chatbot searches through these lists for relevant matches.
Dictionaries (Python):
Scores: A dictionary stores the match score for each sentence, helping to rank results based on relevance.
Sets (Python):
Tokenized Words: The tokenized words of the user's query are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness and help with matching.
JSON (File Format):
Platform Documentation: Each platformâ€™s documentation (Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap) is stored in separate JSON files. These files contain key information and sections related to each platform.
Features
Platform Detection: Identifies the platform mentioned in the user's query and searches the corresponding documentation.
Fuzzy Matching: Uses FuzzyWuzzy to find the closest matching sentences from the documentation.
Search through JSON: Retrieves relevant answers from the platform-specific JSON documentation.
Tokenization: Breaks down the user input into tokens for improved processing and matching.
Top 3 Results: Displays the top 3 most relevant answers based on fuzzy match scores.

Future Enhancements
Add More Platforms: Expand the chatbot to support more platforms and their documentation.
Improve Fuzzy Matching: Refine the fuzzy matching logic to improve accuracy and handle different query variations.
Persistent Storage: Implement persistent storage to save user queries and responses for future reference.
Web Interface: Build a simple web-based UI using Flask or a similar framework for easier interaction.
User Authentication: Add user authentication to personalize responses or store preferences.
