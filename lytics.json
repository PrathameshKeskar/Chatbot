    "Introduction": "A data stream is a continuous flow of data generated from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, email providers, social media, and other digital platforms. Data streams typically involve high volumes of data generated in real-time or near-real-time, making it necessary to process and analyze the data as it arrives. Lytics allows for creating any number of data streams to provide logical distinctions among data sources in either type or scope. For example, data describing email subscriber attributes should exist on a different data stream than one describing email subscriber activity. This ensures maximum flexibility when defining the relationships between sources and how they ultimately are unified into a materialized user profile.",

    "SP-Initiated SSO": "Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by usingGoogle Cloud Identity Platformas a service provider usingSAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO. Once implemented, users will log in to Lytics via aspecial SSO formthat only requires an email address. Lytics will recognize the email address and open a pop-up to the user's IdP to complete the login. Once the IdP verifies credentials, the pop-up will close, redirecting the user to a logged-in instance of their Lytics dashboard. Behind the scenes, a customer's IdP will communicate with the Lytics APIs, which useGoogle Cloud Identity Platformto validate the login. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.",
    "Service Provider Configuration": "To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided toLytics Support: Sign In URLX509 Signing Certificate (The identity provider public key - if possible encoded in a separate PEM or CER formatted file)Sign Out URL Further configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0.",
    "IdP Configuration": "After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider,Lytics Supportwill provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are: Connection NameAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka post-back or callback URL)Entity ID of the Service Provider With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.",
    "\ud83d\udcd8": "We recommend using SQL Warehouses (ideally Serverless SQL Warehouses).",
    "Testing SSO": "Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI. During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app. If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account.",
    "Troubleshooting SSO": "If it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn\u2019t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address. For instance, if the email listed in the IdP isabc@123, and within Lytics it\u2019sdef@456, then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email addressabc@123for the SSO login to be successful. It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP.Other methods of logging in would need to be added (Google OAuth, username/password).Remove user from all accounts and then add them back with the first account being the account that you want to be their primary account. Lytics Supportcan assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side.  TheLytics Supportteam can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account. If you\u2019re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics\u2019 support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just contact us with the details of the issue.",
    "Account Structure with SSO": "It should also be noted that primary accounts (master accounts) are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP.Add other logging methods (Google OAuth, username/password).Remove that user from all accounts and then add them back, with the first account being the one you want to be their primary account.",
    "Assigning Roles using SSO": "Configuring Role Assertions for SSO in Lytics The Lytics team can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) to assign roles via SSO. This configuration must be applied to the primary (master) accounts and any additional accounts to which users need access. For more information, refer to theaccount structure with SSO. Important Note:Users cannot be assigned to additional accounts via SSO alone; they must be manually invited to each Lytics account to which they need access. To set up role assignments via SSO, customers must configure their Identity Provider (IDP) to include a group assertion for each account the user can access. The role of each user must be specified in the format:lytics_<AID>_<Role> Example of a SAML assertion for a user whose default account is 123 and also has access to account 234: Note: This example is simplified to focus only on the group's assertion; a real-world example would be more detailed.",

To get started, however, we need only add your valid Lytics API token to theLytics.shared.startinitialization call as outlined below:",
    "Step 3. Identifying a User": "Once we have initialized the SDK, it is a best practice toidentifythe user anywhere formally they provide additional strong identifiers, such as a username or email, upon login, for example. This ensures your profiles have the highest potential for properly unifying across your various data sources. Do note, this step is optional. By default, the Lytics SDK will create an anonymous identifier for all users and leverage that to merge with disparate sources as we do with our traditional web-based JavaScript SDK.",
    "Step 4. Tracking Activity": "Once the user has been identified (optional), we can begintrackingvarious activities throughout their visit. Typical activities include screen views, clicks, purchases, etc. A full scope of event tracking flexibility can be found in the technical documentation section below.",
    "Technical Documentation": "The following outlines the full definition of capabilities supported by the Lytics SDK for JavaScript.",
    "Identifying Users": "Lytics.shared.identifyis used to emit strong identifiers and attributes associated with your app user. This method provides a means to store the primary identifiers on the device itself so that all future event tracking from that device automatically is appended with information necessary to maximize the effectiveness of your identity resolution strategy. For eachLytics.shared.identifycall, you have the option to only store that data to the device or emit it to a Lytics event stream for mapping to profiles. Emitting all event types to a Lytics event stream is always our recommendation. Exampleidentifycall where we set pass a custom stream, set of identifiers, and attributes:",
    "Tracking Events": "Lytics.shared.trackemits activity data for a particular app user to a Lytics even stream. Each track call will automatically be appended with the strong identifiers stored on the device to ensure the highest potential resolution against Lytics user profiles.Lytics.shared.trackcalls can include a variety of optional parameters and data associated with the interaction as defined below: Exampletrackcall where we track a purchase event and its associated properties: Lytics.shared.screenis an additional method for appending device information to the traditional track call. This is an extension of the above definition and results in including the following information with all events: Operating System Version (UIDevice.current.systemVersion)Device Model Name (UIDevice.current.name)identifierForVendor (UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor)orientation (UIDevice.current.orientation)userInterfaceIdiom (UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom)",

    "Consent": "Lytics.shared.consentis a specific event type for collecting critical information related to consent, such as location, document, etc. As a best practice, aLytics.shared.consentevent should always be leveraged alongside theLytics.shared.optIn()event to ensure proper documentation of consent:",
    "Opt In": "Lytics.shared.optIn()sets the state of a user's activity tracking preference. By default, all users are opted in. This default setting is fully configurable at the top-level SDK configuration. In either case, an explicit call toLytics.shared.optIn()will result in activities being tracked and sent to a Lytics stream.",
    "Opt Out": "Lytics.shared.optOut()is the opposite of the aboveLytics.shared.optInmethod and will prevent activity data from being emitted to Lytics after it has been called until an additional.Lytics.shared.optIn()call has been made.",
    "GAID (Identifier for Advertisers)": "GAIDoradvertisingIdentifieris an alphanumeric string that is unique to each device. Collection of this identifier requires explicit confirmation from the app user, which the Lytics SDK for Android can trigger. In addition, upon confirmation, the GAID will be treated as a strong identifier and included with all outbound events emitted to Lytics streams for improved resolution. The Lytics SDK for Android offers two methods to collect GAID and handle the opt-out of GAID. To present a required modal asking for tracking access and storage/inclusion of the device-specific GAID upon confirmation, call the following method: To disable the storing and emitting of the user's device-specific GAID, call the following method: To support collecting the Android Advertising ID, add the following to the application's gradle dependencies: implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.0.1' Additionally, declare a Google Play services normal permission in the manifest file as follows: <uses-permission android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID\"/> After confirming with the user and getting their consent, enable Advertiser ID collection viaLytics.enableGAID(). The user's Android Advertising ID will be sent with each event's identifiers. Note, the user can disable or change the Advertising ID via the Android system privacy settings.",
    "Utility": "Several utility-type methods are available for flushing queues, resetting stored data, and performing general maintenance or debugging.",
    "Event Queue Flushing": "Occasionally, it may be desired to force a flush of the event queue. This is common after a series of events, before sign-out, etc. This method will bypass any queue caps or timers and result in all queued events being emitted:",
    "Stored Property Flushing": "Strong identifiers and attributes are stored locally on the device. In general, there are not likely to be many use cases where it is necessary to delete all stored data and reset the SDK. By doing so, the resolution will become much more complex, and all identifiers, even anonymous, will no longer be accessible. That said, in the case of a shared device where a user is logging in and out or in the more common case of a test device, the following method is available to delete all data stored by the Lytics SDK for iOS:",

For every element we want to personalize we need to have three versions of the content: Users in theInterested in Dress Shoesaudience.Users in theInterested in Athletic Shoesaudience.Users in thePromotional Listwho have not shown interest in either shoe type (generic promotion). If a user is interested in both dress shoes and athletic shoes we can prioritize which to show based on the order of the conditionals we will set up in the template. We will opt to promote dress shoes in this example for that case.  Follow these steps to personalize your email template in this manor: Open your template in an HTML editor, locate the text, image or HTML element you want to change based on audience membership.Use the customLyticsAudiencefield and conditional logic to bind your HTML content in if/else statements. Take a look at the following example, which the example template uses to change the text on the banner of the example email:HTML<!-- custom headline -->[if:LyticsAudiences=Interested in Dress Shoes]Dress shoes for any occasion\n[elseif:LyticsAudiences=Interested in Athletic Shoes]Kick start your summer with new shoes\n[else]Shoes of all shapes and sizes you'll love[endif]Continue to edit your template to modularize the content of your email. In our example, we also switch out the image in the banner as well as the CTA link and text based on audience membership:HTML<!-- custom image -->[if:LyticsAudiences=Interested in Dress Shoes]<imgsrc=\"dress-shoes.png\"alt=\"dress shoes\"/>[elseif:LyticsAudiences=Interested in Athletic Shoes]<imgsrc=\"athletic-shoes.png\"alt=\"athletic shoes\"/>[else]<imgsrc=\"default-shoes.png\"alt=\"shoes\"/>[endif]\n\n...<!-- custom CTA -->[if:LyticsAudiences=Interested in Dress Shoes]<ahref=\"https://shoepalace.com/products/dress-shoes\">Shop Dress Shoes</a>[elseif:LyticsAudiences=Interested in Athletic Shoes]<ahref=\"https://shoepalace.com/products/athletic-shoes\">Shop Athletic Shoes</a>[else]<ahref=\"https://shoepalace.com/products/shoes\">Shop New Shoes</a>[endif] In the next step you will be able to see the rendering of the templates in each of the three contexts.",

    "Backfilling Data": "Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation.  This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account.",
    "Separate Backfill from Real-time Streams": "A real-timedata streamcontains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger. For attributes that will be kept updated by a real-time stream, there is the additional requirement to populate that attribute with a substantial amount of pre-existing information, separating that backfilling from now-forward messages. Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such asAmazon Web Services (AWS) S3. The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected.",
    "Utilize Timestamps": "Whenever possible,allmessages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows which one is the most up-to-date.  It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute. All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via atimestamp_fieldURL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field.",
    "Evaluate Necessity": "All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process calledrebuilding. Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc. All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no clear use case for backfilling, consider skipping it.",
    "Select Provider": "This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting theWebhooksprovider tile. ",
    "Select Method": "Next, select an authorization method. If this is your first time creating an authorization for Ansira, selectOAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant. ",
    "Configure Authorization": "Next, we'll configure the authorization to use a key and secret provided by Ansira. Please configure all fields as outlined below and leave any additional fields blank unless you fully understand the implications.",
    "Create Webhook Template": "Webhook templates are created usingjsonnet. These templates provide a flexible way to reformat the outbound payload of a webhook request to meet the recipient's requirements. In this case, we'll create a template that provides the proper formatting of email and source ids for the AnsirauserAPI. This step may appear to be technical. As such, if you need assistance, please get in touch with your technical account manager or primary point of contact. Jsonnet is highly customizable. In the example above, we pull theemailfrom the profile and hard code asourceCodekeyNameIf the desire is for thekeyNameto be dynamic, this could also leverage the.event.getmethod to pull the value from each profile. If you use the dynamic method, the field name in the event.get() function is the field name that has been defined in the Lytics schema, as seen in the example below:",
    "Configure  Webhook": "In the final step, we will combine it by configuring our webhook destination to use the auth, templates, and audience to enrich a Lytics profile. It is important to ensure the auth is selected for the corresponding webhook trigger for entrances and exits. Because they have different structures, the data will not be updated properly in insider if this step is not followed. This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting theWebhooksprovider tile. Next, select theAudience Triggers Webhookjob type. This webhook job will pass the response of each request to the configured data stream to be mapped back to a user's profile. There is a list of fields available to configure for the Lytics webhook. The details for those configurable fields can be found in the webhook documentation. Below are the required fields specific to the Lytics and Insider workflow. Select one or more audiences to enrich with Ansira data. We highly recommend following the suggested approach in theaudienceof this doc to prevent invalid or unnecessary calls to the Ansira API. Select the template that was created in the previous step. This should be Exit or Entrance, depending on the JSONNET template it is linked to. Do not select any fields. This will default to syncing the entire profile based on the defined template.",
    "The Lytics' Graph": "The system records each unique identifier (ID) as separate nodes within the graph structure. A collection of nodes linked by edges corresponds to a singular profile. The data associated with the most robust ID present in an incoming event is stored. While not directly accessible via the API, this information is made available through the \"Identity\" tab in the conductor. The graph undergoes immediate updates upon the arrival of new events. Generally, the response time from a graph update to the corresponding entity ranges from milliseconds to seconds. Graph view of consumer profiles in Conductor",
    "Raw Data Store": "The system efficiently stores every event received from Lytics, both in batch and real-time modes. Each event includes a timestamp indicating when the event took place and when it entered the Lytics system. Although this information is not directly accessible through the API or user interface (UI), it is possible to transmit the events downstream using our out-of-the-box (OOTB) integrations, such as theBigQuery (BQ)export feature. This scenario seamlessly transfers the events from the raw storage to designated downstream tables. These operations can be initiated or concluded at any given time. The raw storage option also serves as a valuable resource for replaying data in the event of corrupted or malformed data, ensuring data integrity throughout the account.",
    "Entity/Profile": "The system diligently maintains and stores the latest Lytics profiles, ensuring their accuracy and relevance. These profiles encompass various attributes, such as scores and segment memberships. Users can conveniently access these profiles through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine functionality. Additionally, the profiles can be retrieved programmatically via the API, utilizing any of the existing profile IDs. To facilitate this process, you can reference the profile's URL in the UI, which contains the necessary ID value for API access. The transition from data entry to the updated entity is typically swift, with response times ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The updated entity is a valuable resource for real-time activations, including trigger-based exports, membership in client-side experiences or audiences, and client-side attribute updates. These functionalities enable seamless and immediate user interactions based on their up-to-date profiles. Entity view of consumer profiles in Decision Engine  ",
    "Segmentation": "Lytics integrates Affinity Engine scores directly into user profiles, allowing you to use these scores in the audience builder to segment users based on their Affinities. This unlocks a variety of strategic use cases. For example, if you're a shoe retailer launching a new line of boots, you can create an audience of users with an interest in boots, ensuring that your ad spend targets the right users instead of those with little to no interest. Beyond targeting, Affinities can help you track trends over time. You may notice that interest in boots spikes during the winter\u2014or perhaps it begins to rise in the fall, as customers start exploring options before the colder months. Affinities provide valuable insights as user interests shift over time, making them a powerful tool for trend analysis.",

    "Technical Overview": "The following overview is meant to cover the basics, from a technical JavaScript standpoint. If you are not a developer or are not interested in understanding in detail how the integration will work, please skip toAccount Configurationbelow. In order to properly target ads we must ensure that Lytics has loaded the audiences the current visitor is a member of. As such, Lytics will temporarily disable the initial loading of ads usinggoogletag.pubads().disableInitialLoad(). This ensures ads will not load before targeting has completed.Acallbackwill be initialized using the Lytics JavaScript tag. This callback will be notified as soon as the visitors profile has been loaded. This will serve as the mechanism that completes the Ad Manager integration.When thecallbackis fired Lytics will pass the audiences into Ad Manager using thegoogletag.pubads().setTargeting()function and then complete the process by triggering a refresh usinggoogletag.pubads().refresh(). This will result in the ads loading properly with the desired targeting criteria. NOTE:Lytics targeting works for all Google Ad Manager tag typesexceptpassback tags.",

Note that a cookie created withHttpOnlywill still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when callingXMLHttpRequest.send()orfetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS). Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).",
    "Who\u2019s taking away my cookies?!?": "In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature calledIntelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably: ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1)ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0)ITP caps all first-party cookies set with JavaScript to 7 days or 24 hours. (ITP 2.1/2.2)ITP caps first-party cookies set by the server using CNAME cloaking to 7 days. (ITP 2.3) As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla\u2019s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.",
    "What can I do to replace my cookies?": "With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:",
    "1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy.": "There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.",
    "2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution.": "Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.",
    "3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window.": "Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.",
    "Getting Technical with Server Side Cookies": "In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is theHttpOnlyattribute. https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/ As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverageHttpOnlycookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we\u2019ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences.",
    "Server Side Cookie without HttpOnly": "The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using therandomUUID() method of the Crypto interface. A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case. Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name. Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag.",
    "Server Side Cookie with HttpOnly": "Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing. Much like the above example, we\u2019ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is settinghttpOnlyto true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you\u2019ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution. All code examples in this document are purely for demonstration. Any customer facing implementation should follow the guidance of our customer facing technical teams and the technical experts on our customer\u2019s end. These examples in production represent HIGH risk as documented.",
    "Building Audiences with Campaign Data": "Once you have created and published a campaign, you can begin to create audiences based on the results of the campaign. You can then use those audiences to target additional campaigns. By doing this, you can string campaigns together into user journeys. To quickly create audiences based on campaign results, look for thelittle blue plus icon on your campaign report:  Clicking this will take you to the audience builder with either reached or converted users selected (depending on what you clicked). You can further edit the rule based on your needs. Here is an example of an audience condition using campaign data:  This example shows a condition that will select users in Variation A who have been reached but didn\u2019t convert, and users who have been converted and reached in Variation B.",
    "Why Use Lookalike Models?": "To demonstrate how Lookalike Models can bring your marketing team's segmentation strategy to the next level, we've outlined how you could segment users by hand compared to how a Lookalike Model would accomplish this task. For our example use case, the goal is to identify users who are likely to buy a travel package for the summer. How a marketer may create segmentation rules by hand: Users buy travel packages months in advance, so identify users who are visiting in winter and spring.Users who receive promotions are more likely to buy expensive items.Users who have already bought a package are likely to buy it again. Targeting users that match these three rules will certainly improve the efficacy of a campaign, but why stop at these? Are there more factors that can be used to refine this group of users? How Lytics Lookalike Models would do it instead: What do users who have bought travel packages in the past \"look like\" (i.e., what features do they have in common)?Analyze all the information known about these users who have bought travel packages.Determine which features are significant and which values of these features are significant (e.g., visiting the website is important, specifically three to five times).Analyze all the information known about users who have not bought travel packages.Determine which users share common features with past summer travel package purchasers.Take the most similar users to use in targeting. The key difference here is that a marketer may use a handful of criteria using logical heuristics to define a segment of users while Lookalike Models will look athundredsof factors including potential non-obvious, impactful criteria to define an audience of users for the same purpose.",
    "Choosing Your Source & Target Audiences": "In traditional supervised machine learning, we collect samples of data with one field represented as the Target. This is what we look to model or \"classify\". Some examples of real-world classifiers are predicting whether an email is spam or not, predicting if the weather tomorrow will be cloudy or sunny, classifying a news article as happy or sad, or classifying an image as a dog or not a dog. We do this same thing in Lytics' Lookalike Modeling but you get to choose what the target we want to predict is. This works by providing two audiences: aTargetandSource.",
    "Target": "The target audience is the group of users you want to model and predict, i.e. the users you want to find more of. Most of the time this audience will represent users that have done something favorable that is worth repeating by finding more users highly likely to repeat this favorable event. For example, users who provided their email on a newsletter signup, high LTV users, users who purchased a product, etc. Getting the target audience in order is step #1 before creating the model. This audience defines the basis of the model or the model's objective. Aside from \"positive\" events, you can also model users you might want to suppress like users who have churned. If the data is in Lytics, you can model it.",
    "Source": "The source audience is the group of users to find lookalikes for, i.e. the users you want to target in campaigns after creating the model. For example, if we chose users with email as the target, then targeting unknown users would make sense as the source. You could also make the source audience users who have viewed a certain line of products, users who have been active within the last 90 days, etc. The source should be adjacent to the target. More information on choosing the right source and target audiences can be foundhere.",
    "Automated Machine Learning": "Once a Source and Target audience are chosen, Lytics handles all the heavy lifting of building, optimizing, and deploying the model. For each model, Lytics automates the (1) feature selection, (2) model training and validation, and (3) scalable real-time prediction, which allows you to spend less time wrangling data to build models, and more time to create better experiences for your customers.",
    "Feature Selection": "Feature selection is the process of identifying which features (or fields) to include in a machine-learning model. While all user profile data is accessible for use in building Lookalike Models, manually identifying which features to include can be a tedious and time-consuming process if there are hundreds or thousands of fields. Lytics provides an option calledAuto-Tunewhich uses intelligent feature engineering to select the most predictive features across all the available features.",
    "Model Training": "When training models, Lytics utilizes three model types:Random Forests,Gradient Boosting Machines, andLogistic Regression. Under the hood, Lytics trains dozens of models using different parameters and hyper-parameters to optimize the model-building process.",
    "Real-Time Prediction": "Lytics Lookalike Models update user scores in real-time, so you can start targeting users immediately once the model is building, but also as their behavior changes or new users are added. Rather than using a static list, Predictive Audiences built from Lookalike Models provide a dynamic pool of users that will respond best when they are ready for ads or other marketing messages. You can also adjust your targeting criteria to make the best tradeoffs between reach and accuracy to maximize your marketing budgets.",

    "Constructing The Recommendations": "Start by thinking about how you want your content recommendations to look on the page. Check thePathfora documentationfor the list of available fields that you may include in the presentation of your content. This example will include an image, title, description and a link to the product page.  Next determine how many recommendations you want to show on the page. Similar tocontent modularization, Pathfora uses the concept of groups and blocks, but this time in a slightly different context: Ablockis a single unit of content (a single article, product, etc).Agroupdefines one or multiple blocks of content recommendations that pull recommendations from the same Lytics content collection. That is, the same content will not be repeated more than once in a group. This example has four blocks in the group. These concepts map to the followdata-HTML attributes: data-pfblock- A unique string name for a single recommendation block.data-pfrecommend- The ID of the content collection. Blocks with the samedata-pfrecommendvalue are considered part of the same group as they use the same content collection. There is an additional attributedata-pftypewhich is applied to multiple elements within the block. This identifies what field Pathfora should use fill in the value of the element. See thedocumentationfor in in-depth breakdown of what fields are available and how they should be named. Now consider this HTML example for a single recommendation block: These appear to be empty elements, however once Pathfora makes the call to the Lytics content recommendation API it will fill in the elements accordingly. Setting thesrcattribute for theimg, thehrefvalue for theaelement, and the inner text of the title and description elements. That's really all there is to it. You can repeat this code to include multiple blocks for multiple recommendations, and then style your recommendations accordingly.  Remember that the recommendation API will return different content for different users based on their affinities in Lytics. Be sure to test the style of your recommendation block with different pieces of content in your collection to ensure that it will work for content with or without an image, descriptions of varying size, etc. Or, you may choose to adjust your content collection accordingly.",
    "Additional Notes": "Our SDK may take a second to set the proper hide/show settings for inline elements. If you experience a \"flicker\" where elements are being rapidly shown then hidden and shown again you can add the following CSS line to your website to prevent this: This exact CSS gets loaded by Pathfora, but adding it to your CSS ensures that elements are hidden as the document is loaded. Since this is primarily a developer use case we don't provide any native reporting of inline recommendations at the moment, however it is super simple to link this up to send interaction data to Lytics or Google Analytics. Check out ourLytics Javascript Tag documentationfor more.If you'd like a \"pre-baked\" version of inline recommendations, we also have a version that's built from our personalize modules. You can find the documentation for thishere.",
    "Activating Data Models": "Because the queries that power your Cloud Connect Data Models can have costs associated with your database usage, Lytics doesn\u2019t run the scheduled sync automatically. After you've created a new Cloud Connect Data Model, you'll notice that the Status is listed as Inactive: In order to activate, click theActivatebutton on the Data Model page: Once you click theActivatebutton, your query will complete its first run within an hour of theNext Sync Ontimestamp listed under the Details tab and then continue to run at the interval you selected. During each sync, the SQL query will be run against your database, and your Lytics profiles will be updated according to the configuration defined on the Data Model. Once synced, theTotal Recordsmetric on the Data Model summary tab may take up to 2 hours to display. This number represents the number of rows returned by the SQL query.",
    "Data Model Field Creation": "Upon activation of a Data Model, Lytics will automatically create one customer profile field which represents the membership of a user for the Data Model. Additional fields will be created if the Data Model was configured to include Activated Fields. Below is a guide for how to locate these generated fields within a customer profile or within the Audience Builder (on theCustom Fieldstab)",
    "Deactivate Data Model": "If you need to disable a Cloud Connect Data Model from syncing at any point, you can do so by navigating to the Data Model and clicking theDeactivatebutton. Deactivating the Data Model will not remove its corresponding fields from schema or from Lytics profiles; however, it will cause the values for these fields to become out of date. In order to completely remove the fields from schema/profiles, the Data Model must be deleted.",
    "Total Records vs. Count of Users": "Throughout the app, you may see different metrics for Cloud Connect Data Models.",
    "Total Records within the Data Model Summary": "On the summary page for your Cloud Connect Data Model, under theTotal Recordsstatistic (shown in the graph below), you will see the number of records that are selected by the query based on the unique number of primary keys in the origin database. This may be equal to or less than the number of total rows imported and may be significantly higher than the number you see in the audience builder when utilizing this Data Model.",
    "Count of Users within the Audience Builder": "When adding Cloud Connect Data Model membership or activated fields to audience logic in the Audience Builder, you may see a smaller size than theTotal Recordson the summary. The count of users within the Audience Builder is the number of users in your Lytics account who met the qualifications for the query based on the matching Lytics user field configured on the Data Model. This number reflects the number of records that would be included if you were to run an export of the audience. Most common reasons for why this number may be smaller than theTotal Recordsmetric are the following: If the \"Create New Profiles\" option isn't selected on the Data Model, the count of users in the Audience Builder will only include profiles that already existed in your Lytics accountsAudience Builder will exclude any profiles which are marked as being Unhealthy. Learn more about unhealthy profiles here -https://docs.lytics.com/docs/user-profile-health#unhealthy-profiles",
    "Exporting Data Models": "Once activating a Data Model, its associated fields will be stored as user fields on the customer profile (to see the naming conventionhere) . Therefore, in order to export the members of the Data Model, you will first need tocreate an audiencein the Audience Builder. You can create an audience of only members or layer in additional audience rules to get the most out of your customer data. For example, you could build a Cloud Connect audience using account-level data for a B2B use case and add one of Lytics behavioral scores to refine your targeting based on your desired user engagement level. To learn how to export audiences, visit our Activating Audiences documentationhere.",
    "Content Recommendations": "Content Recommendations are a powerful tool that can be used to increase user engagement by presenting users with relevant content that resonates with them. By utilizing the Lytics topic taxonomy and powerful Machine-Learning algorithms, Lytics can make data-driven Content Recommendations within milliseconds. Powered by over 500 features, and the flexibility to customize your recommendations, Lytics' Content Recommendation API removes the heavy lifting when it comes to content personalization via web, email, etc. Out of the box, Lytics' Content Recommendations can be leveraged in 3 ways:",
    "Content Recommendations in the Lytics UI": "The Lytics UI offers multiple ways to test, validate, and get started with Content Recommendations. Both theInterest Enginepage and theContent Collectionpage provide options for fetching recommendations for individual users.",
    "Recommendations via the Interest Engine Page": "To access Recommendations from the Interest Engine page, navigate to theInterest Enginepage under theContentnavigation menu, select an Interest Engine, and click on theRecommendtab.  After entering a user ID and clicking Recommend, Lytics will generate recommendations tailored to that specific user.",
    "Recommendations via the Collections Page": "To access Collection-specific recommendations, navigate to a Collection under the Collections page in the Content menu and select the Recommendations tab. This page provides options for creating RecommendationsExperiences, links to theContent Recommendation API, code snippets, and a search bar to fetch Collection-specific Recommendations for a user.",
    "Recommend content with Lytics Personalization": "You can create personalized, customizable recommendation experiences on any site where the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed.",
    "Recommend content with Pathfora JS": "Pathfora JS is capable of taking a content collection and fetching and displaying the recommended content for the current user. Read more about it in thePathfora JS Docs.",
    "Recommend content with Lytics APIs": "The Lytics content recommendation API takes a handful of parameters, including the user the recommendation is for and an optional content collection to recommend from.",
    "Using content collections in recommendations": "Content collections are commonly used in content recommendations. By selecting a content collection as the source of your content recommendation, you're limiting which content the recommendation engine can select from. This is desirable for most use cases, because by default Lytics will scrape any and all pages of your website that users are visiting. Without a content collection defined, the recommendation engine will return what is most relevant to the user regardless of the context. For example, in a marketing context you wouldn't want to promote your careers page, even if it is the most relevant piece of content to the user in question. Size of the collection is also an important factor when using a collection for recommendation. The more content the recommendations engine has access to, the better, more personalized recommendations it can serve. If you can, try to make sure your content collection is of a decent size, and at the minimum fits the following requirements: Documents are valid (return a 200-status from an HTTP get request)Documents have been enriched by LyticsDocuments have topics associated with them If none of the documents in your collection fit these conditions, the recommendation engine may have issues returning recommendations as it doesn't have enough information to make a recommendation. If you would like assistance setting up these filters in your collection or to set up a collection with content published less than 1 week in the past, contactLytics Support.",
    "Content collections in Lytics Experiences": "When setting up a recommended content Experience through the Lytics UI, you will be asked to select an existing content collection or build a new collection to use in the experience.",
    "Using collections in custom content recommendations": "If you're using the Lytics API to recommend content, you can use thecontentsegmentquery parameter to define the content collection you want to use. The value of this parameter should be the ID of the content collection. You can locate the ID of the collection from the URL on the summary page. The ID will come after/collections/in the URL, and will end before the beginning of the query parameters.",
    "Affinity Alignment Score": "When building a recommendation-based Experience, you have access to theaffinity alignment scoreautomatically calculated by Lytics.  The \u201calignment\u201d score measures the similarity between the selected Content Collection and the Audience. This similarity is based upon the \u201cvector similarity\u201d of the most prevalent topics in the Collection, and the most prevalent topics in the Audience. If the Collection and the Audience share many of the same topics, the \u201calignment\u201d score will be high. Conversely, if the Collection and the Audience share few or no topics, then the \u201calignment\u201d score will be low. For successful Content Recommendations, we recommend pairing Collections and Audiences with moderate to high alignment. If there is low alignment, Content Recommendations may have low conversion rates and may be irrelevant to users in the selected Audience.",
    "Import Products": "Importing Shopify products allows you to enrich your use ofAffinitieswith product data from your Shopify store. Serve your customers with relevant messaging and product recommendations based on how they have engaged with your brand.",
    "Define: Relationships Between Identifiers": " Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered: How important is accuracy?How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly?How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools?",
    "Construct: Complex Profiles": " Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact. Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity: What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all?What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity?",
    "Maintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles": " Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented. Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers: How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time?What is the process for managing consent?How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated?What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies?",
    "The Lytics Identity Graph": "Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source. To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser. ",
    "Graph Mechanics": "As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons \u2013 new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment. However, we're not satisfied with several singletons \u2013 our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc. In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is calledtraversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors. In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contactLytics support.",
    "Identity Keys": "As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution. For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses. ",
    "Field Types": "Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball. Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.",
    "Identity Key Rankings": "The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers. Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have aconflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules. The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A andnotthe profile for Email B.",
    "Graph Compaction": "We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts. In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy. Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.",
    "Rank-based Compaction": "Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time. Size compaction: Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size.  If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed.Time compaction: These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold.  If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be compacted into a single fragment.",
    "Import Files": "Import user activity and profile files from Google Cloud Storage into Lytics.",

    "Enrich Users": "Enrich Lytics users to addUnified ID 2.0to their user profile. Use this UID to identify consumers to target with more relevant ad campaigns.",
    "Simple webhook payloads": "One of the primary use-cases for templates is for shaping the request payload for outgoing Webhook Exports from Lytics. For example, say you are exporting a Lytics audience calledfrequent_visitorsto a service that expects the following JSON in the request body: We could create the following template in Lytics, and select it in our Webhook Export job configuration to send the correct request, using thefirst_name,last_name, andemailfields on your Lytics profiles (seeherefor details on using thelytemplates.libsonnetlibrary): Once created, this template can be selected from theLytics Templatedropdown menu in thewebhook job configuration.",
    "Usingassertto skip events that have empty required fields": "Many times when sending webhook events, certain fieldsmustbe set or the webhook endpoint will respond with an HTTP error, causing the webhook job to fail. This simple template uses the Jsonnetassertfunction to signal that email must be set before sending. These events will be omitted from sending and will be logged with the included assertion messageemail must be set.",
    "Using templates for dynamic URLs": "You can also use a template to dynamically generate URLs for webhook requests instead of hard-coding one in your jobconfiguration. Say you are exporting Lytics profiles to a service that expects requests to the following endpoint where{email}is the user's email address: We could create the following template, which extracts the email from each Lytics profile and includes it in the URL: Once created, this template can be selected from theWebhook URLdropdown menu in thewebhook job configuration.",
    "Configure Webhooks": "Lytics highly recommends setting up Iterablesystem webhooksfor real time event capture of your events. This will allow Lytics to get real-time activity data such as clicks, opens, bounces etc. on your Iterable campaigns. Lytics requires that webhooks are enabled to use Iterable Experiences as part of Lytics Orchestrate because it allows for the collection of reporting metrics for your Iterable Experiences. To set up system webhooks to go to Lytics, you will need to have a Lytics API token ready, you can read how togenerate a new API tokenif you do not already have one. Then follow these steps: Log into yourIterable account.Navigate toIntegrations>System Webhooks.Click+CREATE WEBHOOK.In theEndpoint URLbox, enter:https://api.lytics.io/collect/json/iterable?access_token=YOUR_API_TOKENwhereYOUR_API_TOKENis your Lytics API token which can begeneratedin your account settings.Set theAuth TypetoNoAuthby clicking theNoAuthradio button.ClickCREATE WEBHOOK.Then scroll to the far right edge and click theEDITbutton.Click theEnabledcheckbox.Select the events you'd like to send data to Lytics by clicking on their respective checkboxs.

    "Recent activity by channel": "This module gives an overview of which channels (email, web, mobile, etc.) an individual user has been active in. When appropriately mapped, it will also provide information on when users were active on each channel (within the last day or within the last 30 days). NOTE: If this module is empty, please see below for details on how to configure the user fields. As with all data mapping exercises, it is best to include your Customer Success representatives for optimal results. If you are customizing LQL or handling custom streams, it is important to understand how this module should be configured. For all our built-in integrations, Lytics includes this data mapping by default. At its core, the \"Recent activity by channel\" module is built from a single user field. This field will not exist in legacy accounts and must be added to the existing LQL manually. For all new accounts that get the latest default LQL files, the baseline should be included. In order to handle either custom data mapping for an account or backfill an old account, the user fieldlast_channel_activitiesmust be defined in a streams LQL file. This field is defined as amap[string]timeand should not be altered. In each stream you'll simply map a string, such as \"web\" or \"email\" to a timestamp such asepochms()in order to update the field. A more lengthy example for an email LQL might look something like: The example above is for when you only want to map the activity event in the case of a click or open. This definition will vary from stream to stream. When it comes to which keys to use, we recommend following these standards for common channels: emailadwebmobilesupport",

    "File Size": "Lytics uses theMarketo Bulk API, which allows an import of activity and leads data via large CSV files. However, Marketo restricts the amount of data Lytics can import daily. The default value of this limit is 500 MB per day. For example, if your Marketo account generates a 700 MB file whileimporting leads and activities, the first 500 MB will be imported the first day and the remaining 200 MB will be imported when the daily limit resets on the following day.

    "TL;DR": "This document outlines how to leverage Lytics' real-time personalization engine to identify visitors who lack the strong identifiers necessary to link web-based behavioral insights with other activation channels such as email.",
    "How does Lytics make content recommendations?": "Lytics Interest Engines provides a sophisticated approach for businesses to gain and leverage insights into which content is most likely to resonate based on behavioral patterns. This is achieved through a detailed enrichment and affinity generation process in real-time. While full details are available in Lytics' comprehensive documentation, the core process can be distilled into four key steps: Tracking Interactions: Monitoring visitor behavior in real-time to understand their engagement with the site.Content Analysis & Topic Extraction: Using Google NLP and proprietary algorithms, Lytics automatically analyzes all the content on your website, translating it into a detailed topic graph.Interest Scoring: Assigning scores to reflect a visitor's level of interest in different topics, updated dynamically as new interactions occur.Content Recommendation: Suggesting content that aligns with the visitor's demonstrated interests, leveraging real-time insights for timely and relevant engagement. This streamlined framework enables real-time personalization, enhancing user experience by continuously adapting to evolving visitor interests.",
    "Why is it important?": "Accurate measurement of attribution and conversions is paramount to assessing the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.With the challenges posed by the deprecation of third-party cookies, particularly impacting top-of-funnel ad campaigns, lead capture becomes a crucial data collection and targeting strategy.In an era of short attention spans, every interaction must be hyper-relevant and efficient, making lead capture instrumental in delivering personalized content.As marketing budgets face constraints, each dollar spent must yield maximum potential, and lead capture aids in optimizing resource allocation.Building comprehensive consumer profiles representing behavioral patterns over time is essential to get the most out of the latest advancements in AI.",
    "See it in action.": "Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and ultimately decide if a campaign should be delivered to their browser to close gaps in that profile. ",

    "Interest Scores & Content Collections": "Your content must be classified before Lytics can offer content recommendations or insights. Typically, this classification process takes 24 to 48 hours, though it may extend if your catalog is particularly large. To ensure the health of your content graph and interest engines, there are a few key areas to focus on:",

Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case. Required Attributes:",
    "Configure Web Experience": "To execute this use case, we will launch a simple lead capture form at the bottom left of your site. The lead capture will focus on collecting email addresses for the user and use a generic \"dark\" theme along with some boilerplate messaging. For best results, we recommend leveraging an offer of some sort that will resonate with your customers to entice them to \"sign up\" and identify themselves. In return, you'll gain much knowledge about this visitor, strengthen your consumer record, and unlock the ability to connect in channels outside of just the web.",
    "Example 1: Content Recommendation Modal": "",
    "Example 2: Inline Content Recommendation": "In this example, we'll use a generic Drupal Block with pure HTML and CSS, but the same approach can be taken using WordPress or a third-party tag manager such as Google Tag Manager.",
    "\"WHERE\" Clauses --> Route Rules": "V2 Conductor Schema does not have a direct analog forWHEREclauses in V1 schema, or LQL. In V1, for example, it was possible to describe a clause to filter data that is mapped for a stream, such as the following, which ignores events whose_urlfield contains the stringlocalhost: To achieve the same result in accounts with Conductor Schema turned on, we need to use the Stream Route Rules API, whose endpoints include the following: GET /v2/stream/ruleretrieves a list of all route rules defined in the accountGET /v2/stream/rule/:idretrieves a single route rule by its IDPOST /v2/stream/rulecreates a new route rulePOST/PUT /v2/stream/rule/:idupserts an existing route rule by its IDDELETE /v2/stream/rule/:iddeletes an existing route rule by its ID Route rules define data to route from oneinputstream to anotheroutputstream. On ingress, the stream on the record is overwritten frominputtooutputif the rule is active and evaluates to true when executed against the incoming record. The mechanics of this imply one important distinction relative to V1WHEREclauses: since route rules describe which records to redirect away from the input stream, rather than which records to evaluate for the input stream, they are in effect theinverseofWHEREclauses. If, for example, we want to ignore urls containing the stringlocalhostfrom our input streamappin theWHEREclause above, we would need to define a route rule containing the following expression (which is the precise inverse of ourWHEREclause): This tells the system to redirect events matching this expression to a new output stream we define on the route rule object. By convention, if we don't care about mapping records that match our route rule, we call that output stream{input-stream}_divert, and define the following route rule object (note the need to escape double quotes inside the expression so that our object is valid JSON): Our object includes several properties which should be self-explanatory:account_id,aid, andname. The rest are as follows: activedefines whether the rule should be activated against incoming data. Marking a rule as\"active\": falseturns it off.priorityindicates the order in which the rules are evaluated (higher priority first) against an event. secondary sorting according the age (newer rules first) is performed when priorities match",
    "Example": "Below is an example of a user exported and how they may look in Acoustic.

    "Exporting Routed Data": "When data is routed from theinputstream to theoutputstream, Lytics will associate the raw routed data to theoutputstream. This means when a raw activity data is exported, the data that was routed will be associated with theoutputstream only.",
    "Behavior Scoring on Streams": "An optional feature with all streams is to addBehavioral Scoringto selected streams. If a behavioral scores are desired for a specific stream make sure the stream that is being targeted is the routingoutputstream andnotthe input stream.",

    "Building the Experience in Lytics": "If you haven't already, you will need to build the base Experience through the LyticsExperience Editor. The goal is to create in the experience in the UI as close as possible the desired end state of the widget, and rely on the API overrides to fill in the gaps that are not available for configuration in the UI.",
    "Selecting a Tactic": "Selecting the correct tactic is key, as it determines whattypeof Pathfora widget the Experience outputs. The tactics map to types as follows: Drive Traffic- produces amessage widgetwith CTA (okShowset totrue).Capture Leads- produces aform widget.Present a Message- produces amessage widgetwith no buttons (okShowset tofalse).Recommend Content- produces amessage widgetwithcontent recommendationsandvariantset to3. The example in this guide uses aform widget, thus you will select theCapture Leadstactic.",
    "Experience Editor Steps": "You will be dropped into thecustomize form stepof the editor. Since the example form has custom checkboxes set to select which feeds to subscribe to, you can't configure this in the UI. Simply click theNext Stepbutton.In thedesign stepenter the headline, body, and call to action text. Select theSlideoutlayout, and under theme you can check theI have my own CSSbox and enter the custom class namecustom-tracking-widget.In thetarget step, select the audience you wish to show this slideout to. This example uses an audience of high intensity anonymous users.In thedisplay stepconfigure when and where you want the form slideout to display on your website. This step controls to thedisplayConditionssettingsin the Pathfora SDK. Once you've completed all the steps, you may want to preview your Experience. Though it may not look or function in the way you would like, this starting experience will generate a foundation configuration which you will augment in the next step.  You will also need to save the Experience to make API override requests. Be sure to clickSave as Draft.",
    "Creating the Override Request": "To make the request for the override, you will need the ID of the Experience you just created. You can get this from the URL of the summary or review page of the experience after saving it. In the URL example below, the ID of the Experience is2d3e345b2ac24acd9d6d3d33f93516fd:  You will also need a LyticsAPI tokenwith theAdminrole. It may help to save the token as an environment variable for future use. You will make aPATCHrequest to the Experience endpoint with the id of the Experience. This command example usescurlandjq: Your config changes will need to be nested in a field calleddetail_overridethis field itself is nested in theexperience.vehiclemodel: Next you will need to convert the JavaScript configuration into a JSON payload containing the settings which you were unable to apply through the UI. In this example that is: formElements- which customizes the form.formStates- which sets the success and error states on form submission.confirmAction- which handles the callback to send the data to a third party. For the most part, you can translate a config to a JSON override in the same way that theJSON.stringify()function would convert a JS object to JSON. In this example, that works perfectly forformElementsandformStates: But forconfirmAction, it gets tricky because it contains a JavaScript function: However, the API can accept a JavaScript function as a string. It may help to minify your function first. There are a number of online tools or command line tools which will minify JavaScript for you. This helps for the API override because it creates a shorter, single line version of the function. This is the example callback function run through a minifier: To include this function as a string, you will need to escape any double quotes within this before pasting it into your config. Putting the whole thing together, your curl command will look like this: Once you run the command, check that the response from the API includes your changes. You may make subsequentGETrequests to the same endpoint to view the entire payload of the experience.",
    "Testing and Validating the Override": "Once you've made the API request, you should be able to view the changes as part of the regular preview process for your Experience. In the Lytics UI go the the summary or editor for your Experience. ClickPreviewand enter the URL you wish to preview the Experience on. Note:If you are using the same browser session to preview the Experience that you did to create it, you may need to hard refresh the Lytics UI before clicking preview. This will ensure that Lytics is serving the most up to date version of the configuration. You should be able to see the updated Experience in the preview. If this is not the case there are two scenarios to troubleshoot: If your widget is not displaying at all, check the JavaScript console for errors. If you find a formatting error in the translated JavaScript config you may investigate and adjust your override command accordingly. This scenario can happen if you failed to escape quotes properly, for example.If your widget is not displaying the changes, double check the response from the API and cross-reference your settings with the appropriate settings in thePathfora SDK Documentationto ensure everything is named and formatted correctly. If the issue persists, you can always contactLytics Supportfor additional assistance with debugging.",
    "Mandrill": "Connecting your Mandrill account gives you the ability to begin collecting email data in real-time. As users open and click on emails sent through Mandrill, Lytics will collect this information and make it available to build segments with.",

    "Types": "The implementation type refers to the development methods used to implement the job. Usually this depends on the third-party provider's capabilities and the resources they provide to outside developers such as APIs or SDKs. Integrations may be client-side or server-side.",
    "Client-side Integrations": "Client-side integrations are implemented in browser-facing code. These are implemented through the Lytics JavaScript tag and usually require you to have a tag from the third-party provider also installed on your web page. Given the nature of these integrations being tightly coupled to the browser session, these integrations collect and send data in real time. There are two types of client-side integrations:",
    "Push Integrations": "A push integration pushes data from Lytics, such as surfaced fields or audience membership of users to the third party. Examples of push integrations include personalization tools such asPathfora SDKwhich uses Lytics user data to personalize the page with content based on audience membership, or data management platforms (DMPs) such as Krux, which transmits Lytics user information to the DMP.",
    "Pull Integrations": "A pull integration pulls data from the third party and imports it into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider, and the exact fields available in the audience builder will be listed in the respective integration document. An example of this type of integration includes the Lytics JavaScript tag communicating with a data layer object on your website to collect data from various third-party vendors such as Tealium or even a custom implementation.",
    "Server-to-server Integrations": "Server-side integrations allow Lytics and the third-party service to communicate directly, usually in the form of a job. These jobs are available to set up and execute in the Lytics platform underData > Jobs. There are two main types of Server-side integrations:",
    "Import Integrations": "As the name implies, import integrations ingest data into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider and job type. It can be anything from identifying information, demographic data, subscription status, or activity data for a user. Examples of import integrations include the Amplitude Cohorts Import which imports user data from Amplitude.",
    "Export Integrations": "Export integrations send user profile data from Lytics to a third-party tool, usually at the audience level. You can select which audience(s) you want to export, and include user data such as user fields, audience membership and more such as the SendGrid User Export. However, some integrations may export raw event data or metrics for monitoring such as the BigQuery Event Export or the New Relic Insights Monitoring job. An enrichment integration uses a third-party service to enhance and enrich existing user profiles within Lytics. These integrations require Lytics to push a list of user identifiers (defined by an audience of known users) to a third-party enrichment tool. That tool then returns additional data on that user such as information on the user's company (for B2B marketing), or additional demographic and social data. Examples of enrichment integrations include Full Contact Audience Enrichment and Clearbit User Enrichment jobs. Many providers support both import and export job types for a complete two-way data sync between Lytics and the third-party tool.",
    "Implementation Techniques": "Client and server-side integrations may be implemented in a number of different ways. The implementation technique often determines factors such as Tier, Frequency, and Resulting Data.",
    "APIs": "API integrations utilize REST or SOAP APIs the third-party vendor provides to send or receive data. The specific endpoints used are listed in the documentation for the integration. Lytics prefers to integrate with third parties via API as it provides a deeper out-of-the-box integration.",
    "Audience Triggers": "Use this job  to send Lytics audience enter/exit event triggers to your webhooks URL. If you use webhooks to export an audience that relies on a time-based trigger, for example, users who have been modified within a window of time, it is important that the window be at least 30 minutes. Smaller windows may not be reliable due to the pipeline necessary for checking audience membership at a specific time.",
    "File-Based Transfer": "Lytics supports file-based import and export jobs. Files may be obtained or pushed to a server viaSecure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). SFTP integrations may be provided for third-party vendors who do not have API capabilities or as part of a custom integration. Lytics has a managed SFTP server that can be used to transfer files, or it may retrieve files from a third-party SFTP server. Another example of a file-based export is viaEmail Attachment, such as the CSV Email Export.",
    "Webhooks": "Webhooks offer one of the simplest and most flexible options for enabling applications to share data. They\u2019re broadly used in the cloud computing world for integrations that can be stood up quickly with a minimal amount of code. The Lytics Webhook integration supports triggered delivery of audience membership (enters and exits) to a destination url where another application can pick it up. See ourWebhook documentationfor full details. Interested to understand how a Webhook integration might be applied? Look at thisMobile Messaging use casefor a simple Lytics Webhook integration to support one-to-one personalized messaging with Twilio.",
    "Frequency": "Frequencymeasures how consistent a user is interacting with your brand over time. More frequent interactions means a higher score. This score measures the user relative to all other users. This serves as a measurement of user regularity. Do they visit once a week? Once a day? Once a lifetime? Since this score is relative to all your users, you can easily target your most frequent users, rather than something like \"users who visited in the last week\", which will vary wildly in size. Again, this score has a fixed range of 0 to 100. All the scores are like this. It is how we can continuously update user profiles without having to update audience definitions.",
    "Real-time": "Files sent to collection should be formatted as regular JSON, where each record/event is an object in an array of objects:",
    "Backfill": "Jobs that use audience triggers also often have an option to perform a backfill of users. Without a backfill, only new users who enter the audience after the time of job setup will be processed. Enabling a one-time backfill as part of the job configuration will immediately process a batch of all existing users in the audience to the third-party tool and then rely on real-time triggers to update user information once the backfill is finished. Some jobs support this feature as a configurable option. If so, it is listed under the \"Frequency\" section of \"Integration Details\" in a job's documentation.",
    "Batch": "Batch integrations send or receive user data in larger batches. Depending on the configuration of the job, it may only import/export a single batch of users once, or it may run continuously, checking for new users and updates to existing user data. One-time run- You may want to run a one-time job to import, export, or enrich users at a specific point in time. For example, if you're running a one-time promotional blast email to a unique audience, exporting your audience once before sending the email would make sense.Continuous Update- Many batch jobs support a configuration option for continuous updates which will re-run the job on some cadence (hourly, daily, weekly, etc). This is common for import jobs for providers that don't support webhooks, as Lytics will want to keep the user profiles up to date with what is available in the third party.Scheduled- Some jobs may support specific scheduled run times, which can be especially helpful for continuous updates. It allows you to specify the time of day the job should run and the timezone.",
    "Resulting Data": "The final way Lytics categorizes integrations is by the type of data it handles and how the job output is perceived. The resulting export and push integration data will vary based on the structures supported by the provider tool, and each integration will document the specific output type. Here is a list of common data types in Lytics for import and pull integrations:",
    "User Profiles": "AUser Profileis the living record of an individual that interacts with your brand. Lytics user profiles provide a view of your customers across your connected channels. Known profileshave at least one known identifier such as an email or CRM ID.Anonymous profileshave only anonymous identifiers such as a cookie ID.",
    "User Fields": "The new user fields that are created as part of an integration are listed in the \"Fields\" section of each doc. These fields will be added to new and existing user profiles as described in the section above, and they will become available for segmentation in the audience builder.",
    "Raw Event Data": "If data is imported to Lytics without being mapped by LQL, this data is stored as raw fields in data streams, which are un-actionable. For example, if you are importing custom data via CSV, you will need queries in place for the raw data to be meaningful. In addition, some pre-built integrations may import additional fields that are not mapped as part of the default queries provided by the out-of-the-box integration. You may contactsupportfor assistance with mapping these fields.",
    "PGP Encryption": "File imports and exports can be decrypted and encrypted, respectively usingPretty Good Privacy(PGP). To create or ingest PGP encrypted files, use an authorization that includes PGP keys. PGP Public Keyauthorizations are used to encrypt exports.PGP Private Keyauthorizations are used to decrypt imports. Follow the instructions below when creating a PGP authorization.",

    "The framework": "There are two important concepts within retention marketing as it pertains to Lytics. While these concepts apply across industries, we will focus on the subscription vertical for this playbook.  For our purposes, we will define these concepts as follows: Renewals: customers who have an upcoming renewal date.Winbacks: recovery efforts for subscribers whose renewal date has lapsed.",
    "How Lytics helps": "Lytics aims to solve these problems by creating a holistic customer view through data unification. Lytics is based on user profiles - meaning any and all data ingested needs to be tied to a user. A user profile is generated and defined by anidentifier: Foranonymous users, this identifier can be the Lytics cookie placed after you install the Lytics JavaScript tag.Forknown users, this is most commonly an email, but can also be various forms of user IDs across your data sources. Richer profiles that include attributes from various data sources allow marketers to run their campaigns more efficiently, resulting in better targeting and remarketing, personalization, cost per action (CPA), among other results. Therefore, profile stitching early on in your journey with Lytics will be important and impactful for your success with the platform. But how does Lytics actually stitch your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) users, to your web browsers, to your email subscribers? The answer is through common identifiers shared between tools.",
    "Step 1: Send all customers to ad platforms for suppression": "Why would you want to throw valuable acquisition dollars on a wasteful audience of existing customers? The answer, you don\u2019t. But your teams are probably doing this today (almost everyone is) because they don\u2019t have a good source for this audience.  With Lytics, you can send all customers to Facebook, Google, Verizon (Yahoo) and other platforms for suppression from lead generating advertising. Building the audience The key to building the right audience is to include all the customers and/or free subscribers you don't want to spend money on. If you are new to using Lytics, see ourAudiences documentationto get started. The following examples skip the first few steps and jump right into building custom audiences. For most companies, an audience to suppress would resemble something like this: Be sure to suppress active users on all your lists and products. This will give the most comprehensive set of customers to limit from targeting. Export a continuously updated file Export these audiences to the key ad platforms:Google Ads,Facebookand,Yahoo Ads. Build suppression in your ad campaigns And then create suppression lists in your ad campaigns. See the respective help docs for more information onFacebookorGoogle Ads.",
    "Step 2: Build lookalikes of your best customers": "If you\u2019re using lookalikes of your customer file as a targeting audience, it\u2019s likely already the best performing audience in your ad campaigns.  Have you heard of thePareto principleor the 80/20 Rule?  80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your customers.  For most companies, it\u2019s more like 90/10. If you can build lookalikes off your absolute best customers, you\u2019ll help Google, Facebook, and Verizon Media to identify the absolute best audiences for your advertising. Building the audience In order to help train the big ad platforms as to who your best users are, send the audience over that most resembles your goal audience.  For many companies, this is likely to be people with a high lifetime value (LTV) or multiple purchases.  For example, your audiences might look like this:  Note that there are several ways to determine high LTV, so feel free to customize to your specific requirements.  The important concept is that you should be targeting lookalikes of your best customers, not lookalikes of all customers. Export a continuously updated file Export these audiences to the key ad platforms:Google Ads,Facebookand,Yahoo Ads. Build lookalikes in your campaigns Build a lookalike inFacebookor a \u201csimilar audience\u201d (lookalike) inGoogle Ads.",
    "Step 3: Setup data science based remarketing audiences": "The next step is to route audiences to the most impactful remarketing campaigns.  For example, you may have certain creative stored in Google and Facebook that better address one content affinity over another.  Additionally, you probably want to consider engagement-based suppressions for remarketing over carpet bombing all of your site visitors. Building the audience Think through which content affinities best align to your creatives. For example, break out your core audiences based on content affinity.  At Lytics, our customers tend to look like the following:  ...or the user might belong to this group:  You can and should use \u201cAny Affinity\u201d to start.  You\u2019ll note that users with any affinity for a topic show above-average interest in that affinity.  To narrow your focus, you might try limiting to \u201cHigh Affinity.\u201d Also, be thinking about the likelihood of a user to re-engage.  Typically, your time window of attention is very short.  Consider filtering for users with highRecency.Descriptive & Predictive Modelingof interactions may also play a role.  Your audience might look something like the following: Exporting the audience Anonymous audiences are continuously exported from the LyticsJavaScript TagtoFacebookandGoogle Analyticstags. Continue with step-by-step instructions topromote relevant content to users based on their interests.",
    "Step 4: Collect emails": "As we mentioned at the start of this playbook, acquisition marketers seldom have the ability to personalize web landing page experiences.  With Lytics, they can.  The next step in upping your acquisition marketing game is to extend the lead generating efforts to your site with targeted email collection. Building the audience Don\u2019t taint the user experience with untargeted email collection.  For known users, suppress your email collection experiences: Building email collection campaigns See theExperience editor docfor how to set up this type of campaign in Lytics. ThePathfora SDKallows easy customization of the look and feel such as the example below. Continue with step-by-step instructions on how togrow your email marketing list.",
    "Step 5: Targeted offers": "Many prospective customers will need an additional nudge to make a first purchase.  The big advantage of using Lytics is the ability to target an offer consistently between site, email, and ads.  This consistent approach between channels frequently provides up to a 10% lift in conversion rates. Building the audience Your audience can be limited to non-customers for special incentives, and may include engagement filters or price sensitivity (e.g. if you\u2019re trying to sell to a known cheapskate). This is a common starting audience:  As a final note, keep in mind there are many other areas to cover including copy choices, optimizations, and common pitfalls to avoid. These are beyond the scope of this playbook, but should be taken into consideration while developing your marketing strategy to acquire new customers.",
    "Behavioral Analysis": "Lytics constantly tracks events from many data sources: web, email, Salesforce, and custom sources as well. Looking at this data directly is not useful; it needs to be summarized. Lytics allows for simple summaries by means of user fields and for use in audiences, but there is more to be learned from all this behavioral data. Behavioral analysis asks many questions and computes the answer. Questions such as: When did the user last visit?When did they visit before that?Is it unusual that they visited right now?During their visit, what were they up to?Did they visit a lot of pages?Did they stick around for a long time?How does that compare to other users?Are they going to come back?Is this a good time to encourage more interaction? After finding the answers to these questions, for every user, Lytics uses these answers to inform nine low-level scores that get assigned to every user who has shown enough behavior for a confident assessment. These scores are computed automatically, they are kept up to date continuously, and they are assigned relative to other users in the account.",
    "Behavioral Scores": "There is a lot to learn looking at user-level behavioral data. Lytics evaluates behavioral data automatically in real-time and reports nine scores for each user.  These scores each represent a distinct behavioral quality and can be composed to build rich audiences. Please note, users must have behavioral data to make confident measurements before they have scores. If a user was added to Lytics via email upload, for instance, they would have no scores. Note:If you are already a customer of Lytics, you can see the following explanation of each score alongside your own data in the app on the Scoring page.",
    "Quantity": "Quantitymeasures a user's cumulative activity over their lifetime of brand engagement. The more activity the user registers, the higher the score. This score measures the user relative to all other users. It is a common tactic to target a user based on the number of times the user has visited a website or has performed some other behavior. This becomes increasingly difficult as marketers add more data sources to their stack, and the user continues to engage over time. Quantity takes into account a user's behavior on all data sources and measures that relative to how the most and least active users are engaging \u2014 so a user's score will always be between 0 and 100. You can think of this as a test score. What is the point of scoring between 0 and 100? This is how we can ensure that any audience created with a score will always stay relevant. Perhaps 1,000 page visits seems like a lot for a user now, but the number will only grow larger as your site grows older and the amount of content you have increases. Another benefit of having a bounded score range is the ability to see the complete distribution of all users.  This is an example of how scores look like across an entire audience. The x-axis is the score (ranging from 0 to 100; 5 to 95 in the example for clarity) and the y-axis is the number of people who have that value as their score.",
    "Recency": "Recencymeasures how recently the user's general interaction has been. More recent activity means a higher score. This score measures the user's recent activity relative to the user's past activity. Without scoring, this would be achieved by looking at the last time a user visited. Although better than nothing, that approach is kind of crude. Maybe an at-risk user opened your email by accident? It'd be an expensive oversight to assume that the user had recent activity and didn't need any nurturing.",
    "Intensity": "Intensitymeasures the depth of a user's typical interaction with your brand. More sustained intense/deep usage means a higher score. This score measures the user relative to all other users. The behavior a user exhibits during a single session is very telling of them as a consumer. If they have high interaction in a session (high intensity) they are more likely to be a deeper researcher or more curious. If they have low interaction in a session (low intensity) they are more likely to be casually browsing or engaged with a certain piece of content, but not your overall brand.",
    "Momentum": "Momentummeasures the rate at which users are interacting with your brand. Users who are interacting more than usual with your brand will have a higher score. This score measures the user's recent activity relative to the user's past activity. It's easy to confuse how momentum and recency differ, but they are actually very different. Universally speaking, we've found them to have a 5% correlation. Recency measures absolute recency of activity, but just because a user has recent activity, doesn't mean they're not at risk of churning. If a user maintains a constant rate of activity, their momentum score will be 50. If they are more active than they used to be, their momentum will be greater than 50 and might warrant a loyalty offer. If they are less active than they used to be, their momentum will be less than 50 and might warrant a win-back campaign.",
    "Propensity": "Propensitypredicts how likely a user is to return with subsequent activity. Users exhibiting positive interaction patterns are more likely to return and have higher scores. This score measures the user relative to all other users. There are many reasons why users churn \u2014 changing interests, competition from competitors, bad experience, etc. \u2014 but from a data perspective, attrition of any kind starts to look similar. Propensity employs an ensemble of statistical models to identify any patterns it can find for detecting how and when attrition starts to occur. With time, it's able to find more patterns in your data and become increasingly accurate in identifying when users start to exhibit those behaviors.",
    "Consistency": "Consistencymeasures the regularity or stability of a user's engagement pattern. Users who engage with your brand at a regular cadence will have higher scores. For example, a user that registers behavior every 7 days will have high consistency, and would have the same consistency as a user who registers behavior every 30 days. As users' behavior starts to vary \u2014 sometimes every 7 days, sometimes every 30 \u2014 the users' consistency score will decrease. Consistency scores can be paired with propensity scores to build more accurate Lookalike Models to predict customer churn and target users with win-back programs before they bounce. Learn more about how to reduce churn using Lytics Lookalike Models.",
    "Maturity": "Maturityis a normalized measure of how long a user has registered behavior. This indicates how \"old\" a customer is relative to your other users. A user who has registered behavior over 5 years will likely have high maturity. A user who registered behavior over 3 years, but hasn't registered any in 2 years will have less maturity. A user who registered behavior over the most recent 3 years will have the same maturity as the user previously mentioned. As an example, you could target users with high maturity scores inviting them into a loyalty rewards program via ads, emails, and in-app notifications. You may also want to consider suppressing engaged users who are likely to make their next purchase without additional advertising. Low maturity users, on the other hand, could be served more onboarding or educational content to nurture them into high-value, long-term users.",
    "Volatility": "Volatilitymeasures how stable vs. sporadic a user is interacting with your brand. It represents the stability of the volume of data that a user is generating, and serves as a slightly more nuanced version of the intensity score. Consider a user where 100% of their daily sessions are considered \"intense\". Their intensity score would be 100, but the score doesn't yield any information regarding the volatility of a typical session.",
    "Utilizing Scores": "Each Lytics score is accessible as a Custom Rule in the Audience Builder. They can be added to any audience definition as an intelligent filter when the size of the audience is larger than desired. For example, when crafting an audience to be used to buy ads against, the size of the audience is critical. The size can be arbitrarily shrunk by taking 10% of the matching users, or it can be intelligently shrunk by creating a threshold with a Lytics score such as Propensity or Momentum. This way, the best fit users remain. Interfacing with scores directly can be difficult. They are low-level building blocks that require expertise to use to their fullest. To make these scores more readily usable, Lytics offers out-of-the-box Behavioral Audiences that use scoring under-the-hood.",
    "Customizing Data Sources": "Lytics scores work best on behavioral data \u2014 that is, data that was generated by a user, like a web view or email open, rather than on list imports or other non-behavioral data. Every supported 3rd party integration is already configured to include only behavioral data in user scores. By default, any custom integration is assumed to be non-behavioral. If you're using a custom integration that you want to contribute to behavioral scores, contact your account manager to update the setting.",
    "Behavioral Audiences": "Since using Lytics behavioral scores directly requires a level of understanding of the data science at play, Lytics also offers out-of-the-box behavioral audiences. These audiences are essentially blends of scores that can be used alone or as a rule in a custom audience. For example, Casual Visitors describes users who come and go without showing much activity per session. The definition using Lytics scores isUsers with an intensity score less than 25. Now, instead of needing to know exactly what \"intensity\" means in this context, or what the significance of the number 25 is, the audience Casual Visitors can be used as a building block.  In this example audience, the Casual Visitors characteristic is being used to filter the users who have a high affinity for \"Computing\". Note that the number of people who have a high affinity for \"Computing\" is 276,046, but the number of people who have a high affinity for \"Computing\"andqualify as a Casual Visitor is 185,747. Reducing the size of an audience is a great way to make a campaign more efficient. Additionally, splitting an audience based on behavioral properties is a great way to introduce different modes of communication for different archetypes of users. For instance, Casual Visitors may not stick around long enough to answer their own questions, try engaging them with a slideout on early page visits. The opposite of Casual Visitors, Deeply Engaged Visitors, are probably determined to find that information on their own and would find a popup to be annoying. Splitting the audience keeps both archetypes engaged without accidentally detering anyone.",

The following code leverages the modern jstag3 listeners to polyfill thely_segscookie to ensure backward compatibility with the Sitecore module. This must be installed after the core Lytics JavaScript tag and should be installed by a site admin who is aware of the inherent risks and impact of introducing JavaScript code to your web properties.",
    "Interpreting Model Messages": "Building effective Lookalike Models can be an iterative process. To help with these iterations, Lytics provides diagnostic messages that identify ways to improve your model performance. In general, these model messages can help you both select the best source and target audiences for your model and create the best predictive Audience from your model.",
    "Selecting the Right Source and Target Audience": "Most of the time, Lookalike Models are built to drive users toward conversion. This flow should be reflected in how you consider selecting the right source and target audiences to build your model. Source Audience: the group of users to reach with your marketing messages, such as \u201cunknown users.\u201dTarget Audience: the group of users that represents the desired outcome for users in the source audience, such as \u201cusers with email addresses.\u201d When defining your source and target audiences, try selecting audiences that are at adjacent stages in your customer lifecycle, rather than at divergent ends of your funnel (like Brand New Visitors and Multi-purchase Premium Customers). The diagram below represents audience similarity on a spectrum of model performance.  Consider the following examples of audiences with different levels of similarity. Overlapping Audiences(Bad)audience multi-year subscriber\u2192audience with high loyaltyunknown audience\u2192audience with no purchasesDivergent Audiences(Bad)unknown audience\u2192audience with newsletter signup and single purchaseanonymous audience\u2192audience with multiple purchasesAdjacent Audiences(Good)unknown audience\u2192audience with emailknown audience of single purchases\u2192known audience with multiple purchases If you\u2019ve selected divergent or overlapping audiences in your model, you will see diagnostic messages to guide you to select audiences that are more adjacent.",
    "Adjusting the Decision Threshold": "Most Predictive Audiences are built by identifying users in the source audience who have a high model score. This \"high score\" is called theDecision Threshold, and in most cases is around 0.5. To adjust the reach of the audience you\u2019re building, you might consider using a different decision threshold. Use a lower decision threshold to reach more users in the source audience.Use a higher decision threshold to be more accurate but reach less users in the source audience. Diagnostic messages may suggest creating audiences using different decision thresholds, but you are always free to make the decision threshold whatever makes the most sense to generate a Predictive Audience of the right size.",
    "Improving Unhealthy Models": "Most of the time, diagnostic messages for unhealthy models will suggest building a model with different source or target audiences. Occasionally, you might see a diagnostic message suggesting that a model should be built with different features. In these cases, the underlying model didn't have enough of a signal in the data provided to be able to predict target behavior. Imagine that you're an online retailer trying to build Lookalike Models for multi-purchasers, but you build a model that doesn't have any purchase data.  Or you want to build an email churn model, but you don't have any email data in your model.  In these cases, regardless of how your source and target audiences are constructed, your model would be missing the underlying signal required to make a successful model. You could either manually select additional fields to include in the Model Builder, or you can use theAuto Tuneoption on the model to have the machine attempt to automatically identify the best field candidates to include in the model.",
    "Accuracy vs. Reach": "All Lookalike Models try to balance a trade-off between accuracy and reach, which are two of the most important indicators of how your model will perform. Accuracy: the precision of a Lookalike Model\u2019s predictions.Reach: the relative size of a Lookalike Model\u2019s addressable audience. As a general principle, you cannot optimize for both accuracy and reach. Deciding which one to focus on will depend on your marketing use case.",
    "Optimize for Accuracy": "Optimizing your Lookalike Model for accuracy is typically used for targeting later stages of your funnel. This enables you to be more precise, with the trade-off of reaching fewer users. By identifying users who are most likely to convert, you can optimize their high-touch experiences to drive engagement, improve conversion rates, and increase customer lifetime value.  In the example above, the model has a high accuracy score of 9 and a low reach score of 1. The shape of the model predictions graph has little overlap between the source and target audience, which indicates less similarity between the users of those audiences. However, for the select users that fall into the area of overlap, they have a higher likelihood of converting.",
    "Optimize for Reach": "Optimizing your Lookalike Model for reach is most applicable for targeting users in earlier stages of your funnel. This will allow you to reach more users, with the trade-off of being less precise. You can think of this as \"casting an intelligently wide net\". By identifying users who are least likely to convert, you can focus your marketing resources on the users whoarelikely to convert, improving conversion rates and maximizing your budget spend.  In the example above, the model has a low accuracy score of 2 and a high reach score of 8. The shape of the model predictions graph has a good amount of overlap between the source and target audience, which indicates more similarity between the users of those audiences. Therefore, you will be able to reach more users in the source audience, but they have a lower likelihood of converting compared to a model with higher accuracy.",
    "Balancing the trade-off": "When balancing the trade-off between accuracy and reach, consider the sum of accuracy and reach to determine a model\u2019s fitness to be used.  See the table below for a quick estimation of your model's fitness to be used. In the first two screenshots shared, each model had a sum score of 10 for accuracy and reach (9 and 1, 2 and 8 respectively). Therefore, both models would be considered \"good\" but they are optimized for different use cases. For a comparison, see the model below that has a moderate accuracy score of 5 and a moderate reach score of 5.",
    "Building a Content Collection": "You can build a content collection in Lytics by navigating toContent > Collectionsfrom the dashboard. Then click theNew Collectionbutton above the list of current collections in your account. Collections can either be dynamic or locked. In the collection builder you can toggle this between these two options.",
    "Dynamic content collections": "Dynamic collections are rule-based, so individual pieces of content may enter or exit the collection over time. Dynamic collections are built by selecting and setting content filters which determine what content is present in the collection at any given time. Preview content currently in the collection by hovering over a content card and clickingPreview this content. For example, you can create a collection that includes all articles published in the last 7 days. This setting is ideal for making sure your content collection remains fresh.",
    "Locked content collections": "A locked content collection is a static collection of documents that you hand-select using the collection builder. Content filters can be used as a searching mechanism to help find the specific documents you would like to add to your custom collection. You can add content items to the collection by hovering over a content card and clickingSelect this content. Selected content items are indicted by cards with a blue border. Once you save the collection, documents are not added or removed until you edit and save the collection again.",
    "Content Filters": "There are a number of filters available when navigating the content collection builder. These filters can be combined in such a way that narrow down the documents in the collection using \"AND\" logic.",
    "Filter content by title, description, or URL": "This filter acts as a catch-all text search for the title, description, and URL of the document. It can be a full or partial match to any of these fields, and the input is case sensitive. You can enter multiple values for this filter type, and the results are not mutually exclusive. That is, if you have entered the search terms \"Dog\" and \"Cat\", each of the documents returned should contain \"Dog\" or \"Cat\", but not necessarily both (\"OR\" logic). Perhaps the most common use of this field is to filter by a URL path. For example, say you're looking to build a dynamic collection of all blog posts from your website, and the URL of your blog posts match the following pattern:http://yourdomain.com/blog/name-of-your-post. To build this collection you can enter/blog/into this filter.",
    "Content type": "The type of a document is derived by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine while analyzing and indexing the document. A document maybe be classified as any of the following: ArticleDiscussionEmailFAQImageJobOtherPersonPostProductProfileVideo These checkbox filters allow you to view content of only the selected type(s). For example, if you want to build a dynamic collection of videos to recommend to users, you might select theVideocontent type.",
    "Published date": "This filter allows you to limit documents based on their date of publication. You may filter documents published after a date relative to the current time or after a static date in time. Relative dates may be set by increments of days, weeks, months, or years. Using a relative date filter allows you ensure that the content in your collection is evergreen. For example you may want to only recommend content that was published in the last week: If you launched a new product recently, you may want to build a collection of content relevant to that launch. Using the static date filter set to the day before the launch, combined with other filters could help achieve this.",
    "Features": "The features filter allows you to select whether or not the content should have a description and/or a thumbnail image. Both the image and description fields are extracted from HTML meta tags during the scraping process of the content affinity engine. Enabling these settings may be especially useful if you are looking to implement content recommendations into a space on your website and you wish to include more than just a title and link to the content.",
    "Author": "The author filter allows you to include only articles written by the author(s) selected. If you have a long list of authors, you can use the search bar to find the author(s) you are looking for.",
    "Advanced Collection Editor": "The filters above cover many common use cases. However, in some cases a more advanced set of filtering criteria is required. This is achievable via theAdvanced Editorwhich is accessible from the triple dot menu on a collection summary or from the collection editor view. From theAdvanced Editoryou can leverage the inclusion of other content collections or a custom rule just as you would with custom rules in the core Audience Builder. These custom rules surface the full set of fields associated with your content during the classification process. Word count, language in addition to allfiltersreferenced above are accessible through this advanced editor.",
    "Viewing Affinities": "To view yourAffinities, selectInterest EnginesunderContentin the Lytics navigation bar. At the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll find a table displaying theAffinitiesin your account. You can filter the list byInterest Engineor search for a specific Affinity. This table presents theName,Description,Topics,Last Modified Date, andInterest Engineassociated with each Affinity. To view the Affinities tied to a particular Interest Engine, simply navigate to the Interest Engine page.",
    "Creating Affinities": "Affinities allow you to group related Topics into a targetable unit, making it easier to reach your customers based on their interest groups. This document will walk you through how to use the Affinity Builder step-by-step. Once an Affinity is created, you can use it to build Audiences and content collections. To create an Affinity, navigate to theInterest Enginespage underContent, select theStandardtile, and click on+ Create New. Add aNamefor your Affinity. This will be displayed in the Affinity tab of the audience builder.Add aDescriptionfor more context. The name and description fields are required.Assign Topicsto your Affinity. There are a few ways to explore and add Topics.Use the filter to quickly findCommon Topics. Lytics surfaces the Topics that are most prevalent in your taxonomy, based on the number of documents with that Topic. The default limit for Common Topics is 500.Click on a row to see related Topics.Select the checkbox next to a Topic to add it to your Affinity.Use the Search to find any Topic in your account. The search option gives youaccess to any Topic in your taxonomy, even if it's not included in your list of Common Topics. This means you don't need to allow or block certain Topics to make the ones you care about available in the UI. As you select Topics, they will be added to the Assigned Topics list on the right. In this example, we created an Affinity named \"Concert Affinity\" that included Topics such as \"Concerts\", \"Live Music\" and \"Performances\". There are two ways you can remove selected Topics from your Affinity. Hover over the Topic in the Assigned Topics list and clickRemove Topic.Unselect the checkbox next to the Topic within the table view. Once an Affinity has been created, you can add or remove Topics at a later time, and edit the name or description.",
    "Affinity Summary": "EachAffinityhas a summary page that provides an overview of how many users are interested in this group of Topics and how much of your brand's content or product inventory is represented. After creating an Affinity, or when clicking any row in the Affinity list, you'll be directed to this summary page. At the top of the Affinity Summary page, you\u2019ll find the following details: Owner: The Lytics user who created the Affinity.Created: The date the Affinity was first created.Updated: The date the Affinity was last modified.",
    "Chart": "After creating an Affinity, it may take a few days for the chart to fully populate as Lytics evaluates users' interest in the selected Topics. To the left of the chart, you\u2019ll find key metrics:: Total Documents:The number of documents that include one or more Topics from this Affinity.Users with Affinity:The number of users who have shown interest in one or more Topics in this Affinity. On the chart, the X axis shows affinity scores on a scale from 0-100, where 0 represents \"no interest\" and 100 represents the \"highest interest.\" The Y axis displays the number of users. You can click on individual bars to see how many users fall within specific affinity ranges. This data helps your marketing team identify which users to target based on their interest levels. For example, you can focus on users with medium-to-high affinity for certain Topics in an ad campaign, increasing the likelihood of relevance and conversions.",
    "Sample Documents": "At the bottom of the summary page, you will see a paginated list of sample documents for this Affinity. Your content must beclassifiedbefore it will appear in this list.",
    "What are fields?": "Fields can include demographic data, behavioral data, or any other data point that is relevant to understanding and engaging with customers. In addition, fields themselves are defined by one of many common data types, such as strings, integers, sets, and maps. ",
    "What are mappings?": "Sometimes, you may want to transform or cleanse messy data before it hits a profile.  Other times, you may want to perform an operation or aggregation to reflect its usefulness for business decisions or segmentation \u2014 like aggregating multiple purchases into a combined lifetime spend metric. In either case, mappings provide the necessary translation layer to ensure each data point collected is clean and consistent. Most importantly, mappings guide the relationship between disparate data points and the final materialized user profile. ",
    "Managing User Fields": "Lytics' profiles are composed of a collection of user fields.  These fields have standard metadata (name, description) and typical properties you'd expect from a traditional database column (kind/type, capacity).  In addition, each field has amerge operatorthat describes how we want to combine data from different sources at different times into a single field.  For example, a field describing a customer's first purchase date would use aminimumoperator to ensure that, regardless of the order in which Lytics sees purchase data, the first purchase date for the field would represent theearliestpossible value.",
    "Creating a User Field": "To create a user field, visitFieldsunder theSchematab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current field definitions. Clicking on+ Create Newwill enter the field creation wizard.  The field creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new user field. ID: An alphanumeric key that defines how this user field will be stored on the profile.Short Description: A user-friendly description that will be used throughout the ID to provide additional context to the field.Data Type: The type of data that will be stored in this field.Long Description: An optional long description that provides additional context in a few areas throughout the UI.Categories: An optional categorization for the field in question. This helps further inform the intent of the field and enhances our ability to measure the comprehensiveness of your user profile and overall C360 readiness index (coming soon).Identity:A field to identify a user within Lytics or in a downstream channel tool.Governance:Any context related to consent, governance, etc.Interests:Information supporting surfacing and understanding a consumer's interests, such as a product purchase.Behavior:Interactions to be used in understanding behavioral patterns such as page views and non-conversion-related clicks.First Party:Any standard first-party data.Intelligence:ML/AI-related attributes such as LTV ingested from BigQuery or scores related to Lytics models.Activation:Data points related to supporting or monitoring activation in downstream channels.Merge Operator: How the merge between two different data points mapped to the same field will be handled.Identity Key: A true or false statement identifying if the field should be used as a key to link two or more independent events together.Keep Days: The number of days to keep values for this field.Capacity: The number of values to store in the set.PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Key: A true or false statement identifying if the field is to be considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information).",
    "Data Types": "Standard: Advanced:",
    "Merge Operators": "Supported merge operators are as follows: Minimum: When comparing two values, take the smallest one.Maximum: When comparing two values, take the largest one.Oldest: When comparing two values, take the one with the oldest timestamp.Latest: When comparing two values, take the one with the most recent timestamp.Merge: When comparing two sets, take the union of the two.",
    "Capacity and Keep Days": "Thekeep_daysandcapacityproperties specify the amount of time to keep values, and the number of values to retain in a set field, respectively. Any values in the set older thankeep_daysin the past will be discarded when the profile is evaluated, and no more thancapacityvalues will be stored in the set. When values are removed from a set due to exceeding the capacity limit, they are removed in FIFO (first in, first out) order. Ifkeep_daysorcapacityare set to 0 or omitted when creating a field, they are ignored.",
    "Maintaining a User Field": "As your schema grows in complexity, keeping an eye on the defined relationships is essential. The field summary provides a window into how a single user field is being populated from various channels. This view is excellent for diagnosing what may be causing a conflict or that things are operating healthily. ",
    "Deleting User Fields": "Sometimes you may want to remove a user field from your schema altogether. This can be done from the field summary pictured above. Click the menu with three docs to the right ofEdit Fieldand you will be presented with a sub-menu. This menu contains aDeleteoption. ",
    "What happens when I delete a field?": "As shown in the screenshot above, selecting and confirming deletion will not have an immediate impact. The delete will request will be referenced in the unpublished version of your schema. You must publish a new version of your schema for the changes to take effect. At that point, it is essential to understand the following: Data previously collected and mapped to that field will no longer be accessible on the user profile.Any existing mappings related to that field will no longer be implemented as new events occur.Any mappings that are associated with this field will need to be independently deleted. Failing to delete associated mappings manually will result in validation errors when attempting to publish the schema version.",
    "Managing Mappings": "Mappings are expressions that provide instructions for how to perform transformations (if any) on raw data.  They can range from simple to expressive or even include conditional logic. Mappings occur when data is processed or observed within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline.  Multiple mappings can map data into a single field, where the field's merge operator controls updates. Let's say we have a user currently visiting the lytics.com website, and we observe the following data sent from JSTag: Based on the data from the event, we might consider some of the following mappings: email_address: no transformation performed, and takes the value of the email as-is.email(email_address): use the email function to validate that the email address is syntactically valid.email(oneof(email_address, emailAddress)): coalesce either email_address or emailAddress to extract the value of the email address.count(event_type) IF event_type == \"page-view\": sets up a counter to track page views, only if the event is of type \"page-view\".",
    "Creating a Mapping": "To create a mapping visitMappingsunder theSchematab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current mapping definitions. Clicking on+ Create Newwill enter the mapping creation wizard.  The mapping creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new mapping. Stream: The name of the stream for which to apply the mapping to.Expression: The rules to apply to the mapping.Condition: An optional condition statement of when to apply the mapping. ",
    "Maintaining Mappings": "Since mappings depend on the data available to a stream, monitoring that things are working as desired is important. For instance, if a key changes or stops streaming entirely, it may negatively impact your profiles and, ultimately, your marketing efforts. As such, the mapping summary view is available to review the health of mappings and provide a path for editing mappings in the future if necessary.",
    "Deleting Mappings": "Sometimes you may want to remove a mapping from your schema altogether. This can be done from the mapping summary pictured above.

As shown in the screenshot above, selecting and confirming deletion will not have an immediate impact. The delete will request will be referenced in the unpublished version of your schema. You must publish a new version of your schema for the changes to take effect. At that point, it is crucial to understand the following: Data previously collected via the mapping being deleted will remain on the profile as mapping changes only impact event processing from when the change has been published.Fields associated with the mapping will not be impacted or deleted.",
    "Enriching Users": "Using email addresses, Lytics will consume Clearbit data to provide more information about audience members. To get an example of the enrichment data returned by Clearbit, visithttps://clearbit.com/enrichment.",

    "Collect Leads Campaign": " The Collect Leads campaign type is used to convert unknown visitors into known leads by presenting a form to gather personal information at the right time. It can be configured down to just an email address or up to a full form, requiring job title, phone number, and organization name. Furthermore, the campaign can be configured to only a set of pages or a subset of your total audience. This allows you to limit the collect leads form to only engaged readers who are likely to sign up, whitepaper download pages where a gated collect leads form will perform well, or only unknown visitors so the people loyal to you don't get bothered every visit.",
    "Expressions": "Mapping Keys vs. Literals To map the data value passed in an event you will want to use the associated key within the Expression. When creating mappings it is important to remember that keys need to be wrapped in single backticks (``). Literals (which can be a string, int, float, bool, or timestamp) are used to map a static value to the field. These are often used with conditionals.",
    "Conditions": "Conditions allow you perform logical evaluations to determine when to store a value on a field based on any of the data passed within the same incoming event. Merge OperatorsMerge operators allow you to determine how a value will be written to a field in relation to the currently stored value.

This information is helpful for technical users looking to gain extra insight into the data science behind this Lookalike Model. R2: A measure of how successfully a model is able to predict its desired outcome.  It can be interpreted as the percentage of variability in outcome for which the model accounts.  A perfect model would have an R2value of 1, and an ineffective model would have a value of zero.Mean Square Error: A measure of how closely a model\u2019s predictions matches actual outcomes.  The scale of MSE has no inherent interpretability.  When comparing two similar models, a lower MSE would indicate a better fit.False Positive Rate: The percentage of \u201cfalse positives\u201d in a model -- that is, percentage of users in the source audience that the model misclassified as users in the target audience.  While the false positive rate shouldn\u2019t be too high, a large false positive rate tends to yield a model with higher reach.False Negative Rate: The percentage of \u201cfalse negatives\u201d in a model -- that is, percentage of users in the target audience that the model misclassified as users in the source audience.  A lower false positive rate means that a model succeeds in correctly identifying the latent characteristics of the target audience.Overall Error Rate: The total percentage of misclassifications that occurred during model training.Accuracy: A measure derived from a model\u2019sR2value, rounded to the nearest decile.Reach: A measure derived from a model\u2019sspecificityvalue, typically ranging from 0 to 10.  A larger value of reach indicates a larger proportion of the source audience that behave similarly to the target audience.AUC: A measure of the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (or \u201cArea Under the Curve\u201d).  ROC curves are used to determine the optimal decision threshold for a given model.Decision Threshold: The \u201coptimal\u201d model prediction value to use as a cutoff when constructing an audience definition.  This threshold is calculated assuming that a false positive should have the same \u201cpenalty\u201d as a false negative.",

You may be recommended by the LyticsExperience Insightsto add UTM parameters to an Experience. The Lytics insights system will check the target URL of your eligible imported Experiences to see if it has these parameters configured and advise you on which Experiences are missing them. For most email providers click information is collected automatically through webhooks or APIs, but for ads this is the only way of recording user attribution. Lytics highly recommends using these UTM parameters in your ad Experiences as it will not only allow you to build and target audiences of users who have converted on your ad in Lytics, but it will also inform Lytics decisioning and insights as the platform builds a better understanding of which users respond to which Experiences. Use the following custom UTM parameters in any links coming from your external Experiences. These variables allow us to link the website visit with a click from the Experience. Thus recording what users clicked on what Experience. The steps for adding these parameters may differ by provider, but generally speaking you can add them directly to the target URL of your Experience, for example: https://www.lytics.com?utm_lytics_source=facebook&utm_lytics_experience=23847 Please refer to the providers that have specific docs on how to add these parameters: Facebook The UTM parameter is recognized by Lytics and mapped to the user fieldConverted on Experience (URL Param)which is available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have clicked on your Experiences. The key of this map field will contain theExternal IDof your Experience and the value will be the number of times the user clicked on the ad set.  If you find that the number of users in an audience utilizing this field does not match the conversion count you are seeing on your Experience summary page, it is important to rememberthe source of these numbers is different. Usually for ad providers, metrics are aggregate numbers imported directly from the API of the ad tool. If you added the tracking URL parameter to your ad after publishing, you may see a smaller user count when utilizing the user field.",

    "Build an Effective Remarketing Audience": "Remarketing to users most likely to transact starts by building an audience that includes the users who show the greatest depth of engagement and have the most recent activity. Advertisers have had success measuring engagement with a semi-arbitrary metrics such as 3 or more pageviews but Lytics has found greater success (up to 60% more efficient) by usingLytics data science scores, in this casequantity. Similarly, usingLytics recency scorehas been more effective than a fixed date range in targeting the most recent users. Using theLytics audience builder, you can build an audience based on twocustom rules. The goal is to produce an audience that represents the top 10% of your total audience. First, add a custom rule based onscore_quantity, setting the value that includes the top ~15% of your total audience. Second, add a custom rule based onscore_recency, setting a value that leaves ~10% of your total audience. You should play with these numbers to find the audience that makes the most sense for your campaign. A higher quantity score will produce an audience of users who are more deeply engaged while a higher recency score will target users who have been active more recently.  Finally, if you\u2019re really looking to get the extra mile, you can avoid spending on remarketing to users that you can already reach through other channels such as email. Consider removing users for whom you have an email address. To filter users with known email addresses, add aexisting audience rulebased on theEmail Capture Status: Known Emailcharacteristic and toggleExcluded. ",

    "Example Use Case": "Consider this scenario to demonstrate why you'd want to create a Cloud Connect Data Model driven audience instead of a standard Lytics audience. Your company sells e-bikes and wants to run a holiday campaign that sends a promotion to any customer who purchased an e-bike in November or December last year. Perhaps you also want to refine your audience to those who are interested in particular bike brands. All of this purchase and product data already exists in your Google BigQuery instance (as shown below).  Instead of directly importing all that purchase history data into Lytics, you can write a SQL query to find which customers meet this audience criteria. By copying this query directly into the Lytics Model Builder (as shown in the generate a query screenshot above), you'll create a new audience in Lytics that will be updated on the frequency interval you decide. Once the Data Model is activated, profiles will be updated with a membership field that can be used to create an audience. Activated fields can be added to the Data Model that can then be used for more dynamic audiences.",

This will ensure the Lytics content corpus has the most up-to-date information to serve in any of your content or product recommendations.",
    "Adding New Documents": "By default, Lytics observes new URLs in all data streams to identify content with which the user is registering activity.  New URLs are enriched as they're observed in incoming data \u2014 that is, Lytics can crawl a domain, but proactively indexing a domain and looking for new content is not part of the Content Affinity Engine's workflow. To add new documents to your corpus: You can send new documents directly to our Content Corpus API.  The Corpus API respects three parameters: url: An optional URL for a new document.  While most documents are identified with a URL, documents aren't constrained to be web accessible.  In the event that you have custom content that is not web accessible, you'll need to supply the content via thetextparameter.text: An optional string of content for a document.  This is only really necessary in the event that the new document is not web accessible.topics: An optional list of topics relevant to the document. When Lytics tries to enrich the new document, the resulting topics will be appended to this list.  In the event that you only want your own custom topics added to a document, you'll need to contact your account representative atLytics Supportto remove all external enrichment settings. You can also use the manual classification module to preview the enrichment of a URL and then add it to the content corpus.",
    "Customizing Document Properties": "Adding custom properties to a document allows you to create advanced content collections based on those custom properties. Imagine creating recommendations from a pool of custom categories, promoting pages with custom seasonality components for particular holidays, adding a custom SKU hierarchy to better reflect your product catalog within Lytics, etc. The Lytics crawler can detect custom document properties from custom meta tags \u2014 any meta tag with a name property prefixed withlytics:will be ingested and appended onto a document.  For example, a meta tag with the namelytics:skuwill update theskufield on that document. When Lytics scrapes new documents, it will append those properties on the newly generated content entity within Lytics.  When adding a field that isn't currently represented within the content schema, the content query will need to be updated with the new property.",
    "Data Collection": "The Lytics JavaScript Tag makes collecting behavioral data about your website visitors easy. By installing our tag, you will automatically begin to collect page-level information such as URL, referrals, and browser data. This ultimately unlocks the power of a user\u2019s content affinity. In addition to page-level data, custom data can be collected to expand user profiles further and support use cases.",
    "Data Structure": "Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively.",
    "Examples": "Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline:",
    "\ud83d\udcd8We are here to help!": "Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect.",
    "Profile Materialization": "Building from the collection strategy outlined inCollecting Consent Data, we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent.",
    "Granularity": "When collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case. For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy. Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints.",
    "Schema": "To handle the response from the enrichment APIs, you'll need to add the necessary fields and mappings within Conductor to process the data correctly. In our example, we will only be mapping the email back as an identifier to ensure data is correctly stitched to the profile, along with a new field called \"Ansira UUID,\" which will hold the UUID for each user.",
    "Field Definition": "When defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as astringor amapand how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched? Type StringBecause consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, thelatestmerge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win.  Type MapFor a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, themergemerge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win. ",
    "Mapping Definition": "Mappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is related tomarketing-consent. Though this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation. ",
    "Building Blocks": "Building Block Audiences provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a \"has consented\" and \"has not consented\" counterpart for each level of consent. This can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below: ",
    "Campaign Segments": "Once you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in. ",
    "Global Job Segment Filter (Consent)": "Configure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream. API documentation can be foundhere.",
    "Javascript Configuration": "Begin with a generic widget configuration containing a static coupon code in the message field. This config will generate a bar widget with a CTA. You can use theconfirmActioncallbackto redirect the user to a checkout page with the static coupon code applied via a query parameter.  To customize this coupon code per user, you can access a field by the field name (in this example,offer_code) from the current user's Lytics profile using the bracket notation. Fields that you wish to use in the template of your widget must besurfacedfirst.  You may use this bracket notation in theChoose URLstep of the Experience editor. So there is no need to make API overrides for this use case. You may be wondering, what happens when the current user does not have the fieldoffer_codeon their profile? There are a couple ways to handle this: Simplyensure that the targeting audiencerequires that the field in question exist.You can define afallback value. This is a default static value to be shown ifoffer_codedoes not exist on the user profile, use the following notation:{{offer_code | FREE2019}}Alternately, you may set the display conditionshowOnMissingFieldsvia the JavaScript configuration if you are using the SDK, or via anAPI overrideif you are using the Lytics UI.",

    "What is it?": "Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that the resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It allows you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match. This definition is sourced from MDN Web Docs, where full documentation on SRI is found. The following demonstrates a simple, non-lytics-specific example, as provided by MDM, of how the cryptographic hash can be added to a standard script element to validate that what is loaded is, in fact, what is expected:",
    "Is SRI for me?": "An SRI requirement often stems from strict security compliance for enterprise-level policies. Though it adds a layer of certainty that the file you expect matches precisely what is delivered, the overhead for managing SRI is often not worth the investment.",
    "What will it impact (drawbacks)?": "With this approach comes a few significant implications: Account settingsaltered in the Lytics UI will only be reflected after the tag has been synced and the SRI hash updated. Most settings updates result in alterations to variables in the core tag file.If leveraged, LyticsPersonalization Campaigns & Experienceswill not be automatically started, ended, or deployed. Personalization campaigns depend on a dynamic configuration file that changes each time a configuration update is made. As such, it is impossible to prevent SRI from blocking the script as it should. This means that the config must be cached and served from a customer-managed resource, as outlined below. Each time a Campaign/Experience is altered in any way, this configuration file will need to be altered. In addition, the \"Preview\" functionality also relies on a dynamic configuration file to be loaded, which means there will be no ability to \"Preview\" an experience before it is deployed if SRI is in place.Lytics Supportcan offerlimited assistanceon implementing and managing SRI other than tag configuration guidance. In the case of bugs and technical issues, our support team cannot utilize existing methods to assist you. Since the file is custom and hosted outside of Lytics, you must do so at your own risk.Bug fixes or feature availabilitywill depend on your team's ability to update the external files and associated SRI hashes, as none of the updates pushed directly by the Lytics team will be automatically deployed to your assets.",
    "Recommended Implementation": "The following outlines a recommended but not exclusive approach to implementing SRI. The following also outlines several options that may or may not be relevant based on your account's features in use and configuration specifics.",
    "What JS files does Lytic use/load?": "//c.lytics.io/api/tag/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/latest.min.jsThis is the core JavaScript web SDK. It is used for identification, data collection, and personalization via the standard profile callbacks or our out-of-the-box web personalization campaigns/experiences. //c.lytics.io/static/pathfora.min.jsThis is the core web personalization SDK managed by Lytics. This is used, and only used, to test and deploy the various Lytics web personalization Experiences and/or Campaigns. Anyone who is leveraging our modals or inline personalization/recommendations will need to ensure Pathfora is included in the SRI strategy. For those that aren't leveraging this directly, they may opt to alternatively turn Pathfora SDK off, which will prevent both this JS file and the following CSS file from being loaded. //c.lytics.io/static/pathfora.min.cssThis default CSS file informs the look and feel of our web personalization Experiences. This file, though required, can also be hosted and customized to your liking as outlined below in the tag configuration section. //c.lytics.io/api/experience/candidate/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/config.jsFinally, this file loads the configuration for web personalization Experiences and Campaigns. If you leverage any Lytics-managed web Experience, this file must be included in the SRI strategy and updated each time an Experience changes.NO EXPERIENCE WILL BE UPDATED, DEPLOYED, OR SHUT OFFautomatically with SRI in place.",
    "File hosting/caching": "Due to SRI requiring the static asset, which is also loaded to match the fixed hash, all assets outlined above must be copied and hosted at an alternative location outside of Lytics' purview. This means that no bug fixes, updates, configuration changes, etc., will be managed directly by Lytics. As part of this asset management, an independent update process is recommended to be in place. Outside of the technical lift required to provide a web-accessible hosting solution, which will not be covered here, accessing, downloading, and surfacing the necessary files outlined above is relatively easy. You should be able to download the above files via your preferred method and surface that same file on a managed domain. As an example,//c.lytics.io/api/tag/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/latest.min.jsbecomes//acme.co/lyticsjstag/latest.min.jsor whatever naming convention you'd prefer to leverage. From there, you will need to configure the asynchronous tag wrapper responsible for initializing Lytics to point to this new asset as outlined below:",
    "Additional Configuration Options": "The Lytics JavaScript tag is highly customizable. For additional configuration options visit ourJavaScriptdocumentation.",
    "Settings Management": "Finally, since JavaScript tag-related settings will not take effect immediately, it is possible to manually configure many of those directly in the tag as well, if preferred over an SRI update. For any other settings within theJavaScripttag section of Vault settings management consult with support for the best path forward. ",
    "Import Leads": "Import your Leads from LeadSquared to Lytics for a richer full-picture profile of your Leads. You can utilize this data to power your communications with your Leads in different channels, or to gain powerful insights on how your Leads are likely to behave.",

You will be able to track any campaign created with Pathforawithin Lytics. Read Pathfora JS documentation \u00bb",
    "Create an Audience of High Activity Users": "Effective campaigns begin with an effective audience. The goal here is to collect email addresses of visitors to your site that are not already signed for your email list. The following audience combinesmultiple rulesto target users with aquantity score of at least onewhoseemail is not known. Users with a quantity score less than 1 have little to no activity on your site and are not great candidates for engagement with an email mailing list. You also don't want to present a message to users who already receiving your newsletter. You are not limited to this criteria. You can target any audience who you think would be valuable to engage with via email. ",
    "Create Collect Lead Campaign": "Once you have an audience of users you would like to target use it when building yourcollect lead campaign. The key step is where, when, and how often you want your messagedisplayedto your users. You may only want to solict email addresses from a particular section of your site and only display the message after the user has spend at certain amount of time on your site. ",
    "Export Leads to Email Service Provider": "Once your new campaign collects email addresses you canuse your campaign to build a new audience. A user who enters an email address will be considered converted, these users can be exported to to your ESP and added to your email list. The specific export instructions for your ESP will vary, see ourIntegrationssection for instructions. ",
    "Using Lookalike Model Percentiles": "Another option to build a Predictive Audience is by using theLookalike Model Percentilesfield. Similar to theLookalike Model Predictionsfield, the Lookalike Models are keys for theLookalike Model Percentilesfield. The percentile for a model represents the value at which a percentage of the predictions fall below. For example, the 80th percentile represents the prediction score at which 80% of all other scores fall below, or more simply put; the top 20% of users. Percentiles help account for the shape of a model's prediction distribution, as it can sometimes be hard to determine who the best users are based solely on the prediction scores, if the distribution is skewed is any direction.",
    "Creating Components": "You can select from a list of Component types by clicking the+ Add New Componentbutton on the Report Page. Click on the desired component to add it to your Report.",
    "Managing Components": "Lytics provides a handful of methods of managing your Report Components. Configuration: Once you've created your Component, click on theEdit Componentbutton in the lower right corner to configure your Component.Minification: To minimize, or hide a component, click on the minimize(-) icon in the upper-right corner of the Component.Stacking: Merge multiple data points into a single visualization or separate each point into its unique component for streamlined consumption.Shrink/Expand: If your Report has many components, it may be desirable to 'shrink' your components to display more information on a single page. To shrink your components, click on the \"Shrink\" icon in the upper-right corner of the Component.Deleting: Click on the expanded menu in the upper-right corner to delete your component.Hiding/Showing Missing Values: By default, \"null\" values are hidden from view. This prevents individual component visualizations from being offset by profiles with missing data. For instance, in the two examples below, you'll see an overview of visitor geo, but if we \"show missing values,\" you'll see a large portion of the users in the audience do not have a geo value at all. This may be preferred in some cases and can be toggled on or off to meet your needs.Organization: As you add components, you will likely want to customize where and how they appear. The location of a particular component can be adjusted easily by simply clicking any edge of a component and dragging it to its desired location. Don't forget to save your changes so they are retained the next time you visit your report.",
    "Size Comparison": "Size Comparisoncomponents allow you to display multiple Audience Sizes on one chart. This component can help compare multiple audiences simultaneously, commonly used for variation testing.",

    "Account Activity Monitoring via Audit Logs API": "Audit Logsprovide visibility into system changes such as creating segments, updating schema, deleting items, new authorizations added, and users added to roles. This is a wealth of audit data about changes in your account. These events are shown in many places inside Lytics, such as the history of work sync events, status changes, work failures due to expiring authorization, or password changes on the source for OAuth tokens.  See ourSystem Events API documentationfor more information.",
    "Navigating Vault": "Vault is comprised of the following sections: Account Usage- an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption.Account Settings- view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories.Account DetailsJavaScript TagLytics APIContentSecuritySchemaUsers- view a list of users accessing your Lytics account, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account.SecurityAccess Tokens- view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens.

Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run.Account SetupJavaScript Tag- learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation.",
    "Who can access Vault?": "Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available. In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under \"Manage My Profile.\"",
    "Notable Changes": "For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities.",
    "Product Switcher": "Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on.",
    "Account Usage": "Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault \"dashboard\" for admin users. ",
    "Account Settings": "Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings.",
    "Users": "The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address.  The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name. ",
    "Authorizations": "Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth. ",
    "JavaScript Tag Installation": "This page remains unchanged, with simple styling changes and updated links to our documentation for troubleshooting.",
    "Anonymous Visitors": "Lytics considers anonymous visitors to be users identified only by a_uid. A_uidis a Lytics tracking value assigned to a cookie. Since cookies can be cleared, aren\u2019t shared across browsers or computers, and aren\u2019t strictly associated with an individual, they are unreliable. For these reasons, Lytics considers these visitors to be anonymous.",
    "The User Profile of an Anonymous Visitor": "Anonymous visitors can still have rich behavioral data. Every page they visited, the number of times theyvisited, the time they visited, and behavior patterns for data science models. A User Profile is nothing morethan the set of known User Field values associated with the_uidof the Anonymous Visitor.",
    "Identifying Anonymous Visitors": "Since all information about anonymous visitors relies on the continued use of a cookie, it is in a marketer'sbest interest to convert these unknown users to known users. Cookies are temporary, but email addresses are not. Note that when a user converts from anonymous to known, all information we knew about them carries with them.When their_uidbecomes associated with an email address (or any other By Field), both Profiles (the_uidprofile andthe email address profile) merge through a process called Identity Resolution.",
    "Better targeting criteria": "Predictive Audiences simplify your targeting strategies by eliminating the need to manually define parameters to sort your customers. Lytics gives you direct insight to help answer the question, \"how do I know what to target users on?\" Each Lookalike Model in Lytics has a Feature Importance chart that shows the mostimportant attributes that predict user conversionsfor your source and target audiences. These attributes include Lyticsbehavioral scores,content affinities, and otheruser fields.  In the example above, Lytics created a Lookalike Model to understand which of our documentation site users are mostly likely to move from \"Casual Visitors\" to \"Deeply Engaged Users\". As you can see in the chart, our model determined that \"Total Pageview Count\", \"Quantity\", and an affinity for \"marketing\" are the top three attributes of users mostly likely to become deeply engaged. Your Lookalike Models may simply confirm assumptions, but in others cases, they can offer a new understanding of your customers' behaviors and which factors really influence desired actions.",
    "Optimize based on goals": "Once a Lookalike Model is built, you can easily create different Predictive Audiences to optimize the balance between reaching more people and targeting your best customers for each campaign. When reach is a priority, you can build Predictive Audiences with higher reach but lower accuracy to target more users. When Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is a priority, you can build Predictive Audiences with higher accuracy but lower reach to target only the users mostly likely to convert.  For example, if you're targeting single purchasers to encourage them to become repeat purchasers, accuracy may be more important than reach. Learn more about how to optimize the trade-off betweenaccuracy vs. reach.",
    "Use cases across the customer lifecycle": "Predictive Audiences help you engage and convert customers across their lifecycle, from anonymous users visiting your website for the first time, to high lifetime value (LTV) customers that are brand advocates. Below are common examples of how to build Lookalike Models that power Predictive Audiences through different stages of your marketing funnel. Earlier stages: Which of my anonymous users are most likely to convert to known users?Which of my users with free trials are most likely to convert to subscribers? Mid stages: Which of my single purchasers are most likely to become multi-purchasers?Which of my highly engaged users are most likely to become subscribers? Later stages: Which of my subscribers are most likely to churn?Which of my engaged users are likely to make a purchase soon and do not require additional marketing?",
    "Topics & Affinities": "Topics & Affinitiescan be viewed under their respective tabs. The Topics view shows all of the Topics associated with the Default Interest Engine. Clicking on a Topic will present more information a specific Topic. Similarly, the Affinities tab displays all the Affinities associated with the Default Interest Engine.",

The NLP-based Topics and user interests (saved in thelytics_contentfield) provide powerful insights that can be useful in downstream dashboard and analysis tools. This data can also be exported to email tools for powerful email personalization.",
    "How Insights Work": "Insights surface meaningful data and recommended action, enabling you to make better, data-driven decisions during your campaign planning and execution. The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions: Fact: Observable, data-driven information providing demonstrable value. This is a unique set of raw metrics, such as the number of users or the amount of lift.Action: Suggested behavior based on user role, data source, activation channels, industry, etc. This is the contextualization of a fact into something to be done. Insights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood. This is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer\u2019s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook.",
    "Insight Cards": "Insights are presented asInsight Cardsthat are available throughout the entire app.Simply navigate to the left-hand side of the Lytics UI to open theInsights Drawer, which contains a list ofInsight Cardsunique to your account. Below is an example of an Insight card and what it's comprised of:  Creation date: When the Insight was generated.Expiration date: When the Insight will be removed from the drawer. Insights expire after 2 weeks.Insight statement: The explanation or comparison of noteworthy data will depend on the type of Insight. You can click on an audience name to view its summary report.Recommended action: Lytics will suggest how you can apply this Insight to your targeting along with a related use case.Expanded definition: View more details by clicking the arrow. This example explains the Lytics score or other data field being calculated. Insights are generated and refreshed on aweekly basisto ensure you are viewing the most recent user data. Insights expire after 2 weeks, so you only target and activate an audience and campaigns during a relevant time frame. The Insights Drawer will display a maximum of 25 cards at a time. Insights will be created for up to10 custom audiences, in addition to Lytic's out-of-the-box engagement audiences. Lytics will prioritize Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences.",
    "Compositional Insights": "Compositional Insights help you understand the makeup of your audiences. This information can answer, \u201cwhat makes an audience unique?\u201d and \u201cHow should I target these users differently?\u201d Compositional Insights make it easier for you to create effective segmentation strategies. They compare data fields within audiences to surface which attributes drive user behavior. Compositional Insights currently include the following:",
    "Audience Pairs": "This Insight compares high-value audiences on their levels of engagement.

For example, you may target these at-risk users with a win-back campaign.",
    "Field Candidates": "This Insight compares the prevalence of specific data fields within two audiences. Candidates included arefields used in audience definitionsand fields from thePromoted Schema Fieldsin yourAccount Settings.  Having a granular understanding of your audiences allows you to make more strategic targeting decisions. For example, there may be a data field that your organization is paying to collect. If you discover through an Insight Card that this field is not performing as expected in your campaigns, you could save marketing spend by eliminating that field and using others that are shown to be more predictive of user behavior.",
    "Experience Management": "This Insight will surface when an experience is missing UTM parameters, which enable Lytics to track conversions from downstream tools such as Facebook.  While this Insight is more straightforward than the other types Lytics offers, it helps you quickly identify when an Experience configuration is incomplete, affecting your ability to track performance and target users who have previously engaged in future campaigns.",
    "Experience Performance": "The Experience Performance module gives a summary view of all the campaigns you imported into Lytics including the conversion rate of each campaign, and how much this conversion is impacting your marketing goal. Use these metrics to prompt discovery into your campaign performance. Select an Experience from the list to view its specific Intelligence Report to surface additional actions and recommendations.",
    "Activating against Lytics Behavioral Scores": "User engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement. Below are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience hashigherbehavioral scores (anything above 50) orlowerbehavioral scores (anything below 50).",
    "Targeting Users with Low Engagement": "There are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions.",
    "Targeting Users with High Engagement": "When creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences. You can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies. View the Audience summary by clicking the audience name on your Insight Card to see the history of this audience and its characteristics.",

Of course, this is a basic example and something more realistic might be represented by the following examples.",
    "Browsers and Cookies": "The following limits apply to client-side integrations, which are implemented in browser-facing code through the Lytics JavaScript tag and typically a third-party tag as well.",
    "Custom Modeling": "Lytics enables you to build custom Lookalike Models as a proprietary service that uses your first-party data to evaluate audiences and conversion rates.",
    "Defining your Audiences and Content": "In this example you will use three audiences to determine what content should be shown in a section to the right of the main hero for the website. This is a small scale example, but as you can imagine this technique could be applied to multiple, major parts of your website to completely customize the site for your users. Before your team does any design or copy writing it may help to determine which key Lytics audiences you would like to target. If your organization has the concept of \"personas\" you may want to think about how your website should communicate and look to each of these personas and then build or use existing audiences that represent these user archetypes. Regardless of the scale of your project, the audiences should inform the messaging. Once you have finalized the audience definitions, designs, and copy for your inline personalized modules, simply start by building out the content as you normally would with HTML and CSS on your website. Start with the content to be displayed to a single audience. This is the HTML example of content displayed to first time visitors of the website:  Go ahead and build out all the code for each of your audiences. It may help to comment out the options that will be shown to different audiences as you go, so that you can simulate what an end user in each audience will see instead of viewing all personalized content options at once.",
    "Implementing Content Modularization": "When all of your content is good to go it's time to apply the audiences. Consider the following definitions: Ablockis a unit of content to be displayed to a single audience within a group.Agroupmay be made up of one or many content blocks, each with unique audiences. The end user will only be able to see one block on the webpage per group. Thus blocks within a group might need to be formatted similarly as they will take up the same space on the page. In the example code, there is a single group which will control the content displayed to the right of the hero, and four blocks within that group: one for each audience, and a fourth block to be displayed to users who are not a member of any of the audiences associated with the other blocks in the group. These concepts map to code with the followingdata-attributes: data-pftrigger- The ID of the audience you wish to display the block to. Each unique value for this attribute defines the element as different block within the group.data-pfgroup- A string name unique to the group which differentiates it from other personalization groups defined on the page. This name should be descriptive regarding a commonality between its content blocks such as placement on the page. Remember to check out thePathfora documentationfor more information on these attributes and additional code examples. Putting it all together, here's what the full content modularization example code looks like: ",
    "Yahoo Sign In": "Yahoo Sign In is an Oauth2 based authorization for the Yahoo Gemini platform. Enter your Yahoo login credentials in the login popup.In theLabeltext box, enter a name for the authorization(optional) In theDescriptiontext box, enter a description for this authorization ",

You are responsible for managing consent.",
    "Using Custom Audiences in campaigns": "Within a few minutes the exported audience from Lytics should be visible in the Yahoo Gemini dashboard. The full synchronizing time depends on the size of the exported audience, and will usually take 24 hours to see the audience count updated to reflect the full export. ",
    "DataX Export Audience": "Export users to Yahoo DataX for targeting across Yahoo's platform.",
    "Partner Match": "Add a Partner Identifier to your users (PXID) to use across the yahoo platform.",
    "Content Enrichment": "To better understand how users are engaging with content, Lytics first needs to understand that content itself. One way Lytics does this is by analyzing the URLs that are passed to Lytics to determine the topics that best describe the URL. When Lytics receives data about actions taken by a customer, it is called an event. Each event has fields that store pieces of information describing the event, including the URL. By associating topics with URLs, Lytics is also able to understand which topics a user has engaged with. In doing so, the Lytics Content Affinity Engine can find relevant content for users, as well as find relevant users for content. When Lytics receives an event with a URL in it - specifically when an event with a field namedurlcomes in on any data stream - Lytics determines whether the URL is new or not. A new URL is one that Lytics has not previously handled. Lytics then creates a new event and writes that event to the data streamlytics_content_enrich, called thecontent enrichment stream. An LQL query namedlytics_contenthandles events written to the content enrichment stream. This results in a new entity being created in thecontenttable. Lytics listens for events with new URLs on the content enrichment stream. When a new event is available, Lytics runs the URL enrichment process. Data enrichment is a common practice in Lytics. It refers to the ability to add data onto inbound data to improve its quality. This process is also used in user profile enrichment.",
    "Enrichers": "Enrichment is handled by components calledenrichers. Each enricher performs a specific task. A common task for an enricher is to associate topics with a URL, but there are other tasks that enrichers can perform. Whatever its specific purpose, the result of an enricher running is that additional data may be added to the inbound data (event). After the enrichers run, another new event is written to the content enrichment process. This time, the new event is not enriched because the URL is not new. But the event includes all of the data that was previously added during the enrichment process, so when the querylytics_contentruns, it is able to map that new data to the corresponding entity in the content table. The specific enrichers that Lytics uses depends on how your account is configured. The account settingenrich_content_sourcescontrols which enrichers are used. Your Lytics representative can help you change the enrichers that are enabled on your account.",
    "Meta Enricher": "The meta enricher is always used by Lytics for content enrichment. The meta-enrichment process begins with Lytics sending a request for the URL. The response allows Lytics to collect some information to improve the efficiency of the overall enrichment process. Examples of information collected are: Status code- This is data returned from the web server that handled the request. It tells Lytics whether the URL is valid and accessible on the server. This is important because Lytics is able to generate content recommendations, and you don't want Lytics to include URLs that will result in a 404 or other errors.Meta tags- Lytics can read data from certain meta tags to associate topics with a URL. This logic runs during the meta-enrichment process.Canonical URL- The content on a web page may be accessible using multiple URLs. For example, a product online may appear in multiple categories. The canonical URL is used to associate the multiple product pages with one another. This is an important value to ensure Lytics doesn't process the same content multiple times, just because the URL is different.",
    "Natural Language Processing": "The following Natural Language Processing (NLP) services are available in Lytics for content enrichment. Each link takes you to the Language support page for that service, if applicable. The Setting column denotes the account setting change needed to enable the service, which must be enabled byLytics Support.",
    "Topic Extraction": "Since Lytics collects and stores every event without any aggregation, automatic topic extraction becomes a possibility. For every URL seen, Lytics uses a bot (calledlyticsbot) to fetch the web page at that URL. The content, metadata and images of the URL is analyzed and boiled down to a set of Topics.",
    "Lytics Content Authorization": "If some of your content is premium and requires a login to access, then you'll need to create a new authorization so Lytics can access this content. To do this: AccessVaultby using the product switcher at the top left or following thislink.From the left hand menu selectSecurityand thenAuthorizationsChoose+ Create Newto begin the creation of anew authorization method.When prompted to select a provider selectLytics Content.Next, you'll need to choose an authentication method. Lytics currently supportsbasic authenticationorcookies.Follow the configuration guidance for your selected authorization and then save.Once you have saved your authorization Lytics will automatically recognize that it is available and leverag eit during subsequent enrichment runs.",
    "lyticsbot Directive Configurations": "Whenlyticsbotscrapes your content, you can identify it with some HTTP headers that will be present on every request, namely: User-Agent:lyticsbotLytics-Id:<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> This will allow you to identify requests from Lytics to scrape that content to enhance your topic graph. For some websites it is desirable to allowlyticsbotto crawl everything as fast as possible. However, some web administrators would like more flexibility and control over how fast and where the bot attempts to pull content from. The bot will follow a set of directives that would be located at the root of the website, for instancehttps://www.lytics.com/robots.txt. Below you can see three commonrobots.txtconfigurations. Disallowlyticsbotfrom attempting to crawl any links that reside in the/admindirectory. Add a \"crawl delay\" to set the amount of time (in seconds) in between crawl attempts (effectively allow the bot to only crawl 8,640 pages a day) Combine the disallow and crawl delay settings.",
    "Providing Custom Topics": "Lytics will automatically extract topics from the main content at a URL, but sometimes domain specific topics are also desired to track. In this case, Lytics supports a special meta tag for annotating custom topics. Provide a comma-separated list of topics in alytics:topicsmeta element in your HTML source. Here is an example from a Lytics blog post: Additionally, your Lytics account can be configured to also scrape other meta tags to feed into your topic graph by setting the account'scontent_custompropssetting to the names of the meta tags you'd also like to include. For example, if you wanted your Lytics topic graph to include topics from yourarticle:tagmeta tags, you could update your account settings with the following API request. Now, after adding thearticle:tagtopic, any values fromarticle:tagmeta tags will also appear in the topic graph \u2014 which means they'll be eligible for content affinities, targeting and personalization, and inform content recommendations.",
    "Viewing Topics Assigned to a Document": "Each document is assigned a URL as a unique identifier. You can use the Lytics Content API to retrieve a document and view the topics assigned to it. This will return a JSON object of the requested document: You can see the topics assigned to the requested content and the relevancy range of those topics from 0 to 1.",
    "Manually Assigning Topics": "In most cases topic extraction automatically assigns the expected topic to your content. If, however, you find that to not be the case or you would like to expand the topics assigned to content, Lytics allows you to manually assign topics to your content. Content is stored in an entity called a document. Each document is a collection of fields each storing a specific piece of information about that content. Each document may have multiple fields that are used to store the topics for that particular entity. The process of manually assigning topics involves updating one of those fields.",
    "Assigning Topics Manually": "Manually assigning topics can be done in several ways:",
    "Removing Topics Manually": "When a topic is associated with a document, a new field is created on the entity. The field stores a value from zero (no relevance) to one (highest relevance). In Lytics, you cannot delete fields from documents. So, technically, there is no way to remove a topic from being associated with a content entity. Instead, what you do is set the relevance to zero. Since zero indicates no relevance, it effectively removes the topic from the document. Removing a topic is not the same as blocking a topic. Blocking a topic acknowledges that a topic may be relevant but is too generic to be useful. For example, at Lytics we block the topic \"data\" because that topic is relevant on almost all of our content, and for that reason it is not useful at all. Topics can be removed from content using one of the following approaches.",
    "Configure service account": "You will need a service account credential file to use this authorization type. If you do not have one, follow the instructions inGoogle's documentationto create one. You will need to give Lytics one of the following roles depending on how you want to configure your workflow: Pub/Sub Adminlevel permissions allows Lytics to create and receive new subscriptions without any problems.Pub/Sub Editorlevel permissions will also work. For importing into Lytics, the following IAM roles need to be added to the service account: pubsub.topics.listpubsub.topics.getpubsub.subscriptions.getpubsub.subscriptions.consumepubsub.topics.attachSubscriptionpubsub.subscriptions.create(Optional, but you must provide an existing subscription if your role does not have this action.) For exporting events to PubSub, you will need the following IAM roles added to the service account: pubsub.topics.listpubsub.topics.getpubsub.topics.publishpubsub.topics.create(Optional, but you must provide an existing topic if your role does not have this action.)",
    "Authorize integration": "If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information. SelectGoogle Cloudfrom the list of providers.Select theCloud Pub/Sub Service Account JWTmethod.Enter aLabelto identify your authorization.(Optional) Enter aDescriptionfor further context on your authorization.In theCert JSONtextbox, copy the contents of your service account's credential file.ClickSave Authorization.",
    "Export Stream": "Export event data from any Lytics data stream to Google PubSub topic. NOTE: Unlike user fields, events are not represented within the Lytics dashboard. Events are the raw data received from integrations as seen in your Data Streams.",

    "LQL & Data Import Basics": "Let's take an in-depth look at Lytics Query Language (LQL) and custom data imports. We'll cover a basic overview of LQL itself, how data identities are resolved across streams, how you can map custom data and finally a few of the different ways to import custom data into your account. Difficulty: Intermediate TLDR:Checkout thedata upload documentationand thequery documentation.",
    "Prerequisites": "httpie- (optional) a more user friendly version of cURL that we'll be using in this guide for readability.Lytics Command Line Tool- (optional) we'll show you how to execute commands with our CLI for each endpoint that is supported.A valid API token for your Lytics account (learn about managing API tokens). For ease of use we suggest adding as an environment variable in your command line:",
    "1. Lytics Data Processing Review": "Due to the intermediate nature of this course it is important that you already possess a strong understanding of segmentation, user fields and data streams. For those new to the Lytics data pipeline we recommend reviewing the following documentation before proceeding with the rest of the steps: Introduction: Lytics Data CollectionIntroduction: Lytics User Profiles & User FieldsIntroduction: Lytics Audiences",
    "2. Sending Data from a Website (JavaScript)": "When the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed we will automatically begin collecting standard data. This includes page-view level information such as URL, browser, Lytics Cookie Id, etc. In addition to the standard page-view event the Lytics tag empowers marketers to push more sophisticated data related to the end user's behavior or identity. An example of such data to a custom stream calledcustom_datamight look something like: While visiting your site that has the Lytics JavaScript tag installed you can leverage Chrome's developer tools, specifically the console, to manually fire this \"send\" request and pass the payload above to Lytics. Keep in mind, all data sent from your browser will automatically be associated with your current cookie. When testing and playing it is best practice to always use a fresh incognito browser. Chrome tools has greatdocumentationif they are new to you as well. Check out our JavaScript tagdata collection docsfor more details on the power of the Lytics tag.",
    "3. What is LQL?": "Lytics Query Language(LQL) is the transformation layer that makes passing arbitrary, non-schema specific data to Lytics. For the most basic implementations it is simply the translation of raw event data to user field data, the Lytics schema. In more advanced implementations complex calculations can be performed on events across streams to create sums, maps, and more. An example might be rolling allpurchase_totalvalues for individual conversions into apurchase_total_over_timefield that holds the total revenue for that particular profile. LQL is very powerful and we recommend working directly with our services team to get the most out of it. We also have some greatdocsto give you some more detail on the pre-built power. As mentioned in our documentation, LQL can be broken down into 6 key components:",
    "SELECT": "Select data to be added to user profiles. Including Maps, Counts, and other complex data types. As an example from the above event we sent from the browser you might mapstatusto the custom fieldcurrent_statusin order to unify data across streams. In that case your select statement would be something like: wherestatusis the key name from the event stream andcurrent_statusis the field name that is used across multiple streams. TheSHORTDESCallows you to add more context around that particular field in order to simplify working with the data inside the Lytics admin.",
    "FROM": "The stream to select from. In our example case this would simply be:",
    "INTO": "This is USER for all user profiles. (technically you could create other types, such as \u201caccount\u201d).",
    "WHERE": "Filters out entire records to not be included/analyzed. Bots, Employees, Test data. In our example we might want to exclude anyone not from Winterfell.",
    "BY": "What field are we going to identify this entity by. This is among the most important aspects of LQL. This defines which fields can be used as keys to merge data fragments together into a user profile. For instance: Means that anytime an email address or userid matches, regardless of its origin, we can assume that is the same user, thus merging all data associated with that key.",
    "ALIAS": "The alias is primarily an internal value of how to reference this particular LQL statement. When accessing LQL through the UI it would be referenced by this alias:",
    "4. Writing LQL": "Now that we know the basics of LQL we can put it all together in such a way that our sample data sent can be mapped into user fields. Though this can be totally customized to your liking the end product might look something like: All that is left once we have completed writing is to save our LQL file. This file name is completely up to you but should end with.lql. This will simplify the next step when we test our LQL before uploading it to our account.",
    "Install Lytics CLI": "Now that we have our LQL saved locally using the.lqlextension we are ready to test. To test we will use the Lytics CLI tool. The CLI tool and installation instructions can be found onGithub. Once we have installed the CLI tool lets verify it is working properly. In the terminal of your choice run the following command(s): If you are presented with a help menu you are good to go, if an error comes back or something was not found we recommend going through the CLI tools docs again to get it properly configured.",
    "Create a Sample CSV": "The Lytics CLI can test LQL in two ways. First, it will read some of the recent events from the target stream and show you the processed output. This is valuable when it comes to altering existing LQL but may present challenges when you are writing net new LQL on data that has not been sent to Lytics yet. For that use case we'll generate a CSV file to read from locally. In addition, though not demonstrated here, Lytics watch can also use a JSON file locally in addition to the CSV. CSV's can be created using a variety of tools. When creating your own CSV from scratch just ensure that the first row in the CSV is used to define your field keys(headers) and then each following row represents an individual user's data. When saving your CSV ensure the file name matches that of your lql with.csvin place of.lql. For instance if your LQL file is namedmy_sample_file.lqlyour CSV should be namedmy_sample_file.csvand be located in the same directory. The Lytics CLI will look for CSVs with the same file name as your LQL file.",
    "Activate Lytics Watch": "Lytics watch will listen for changes to your LQL file. When that happens it will take the CSV or recent data from your stream and process it using that newly altered LQL. This translation is then output into your terminal in order to validate that all mappings are working properly.",
    "6. Uploading LQL to an Account": "NOTE:Please be sure you are using the correct API token when performing the next operation. To check which API you currently have set simply run the following in your terminal: The value output should match the API token pulled from your account. If this is not the case please revisit the prerequisites section above for setting up you API token.",
    "Query POST Request": "To upload the query you will make a simple POST request to our API. Upon a successful upload you will get a response of200. Lytics handles everything else from there.",
    "7. Importing a CSV": "Finally we can import our CSV using a standard cURL command. Be sure to update your file and stream name in the example below:",
    "What's next?": "The endpoints we covered here will get you started with Lytics segments. We do have a couple segment APIs that were not covered in this guide, primarily around segment size. The API for this is quite simple, check outour docsif you're interested. It also may help to look at thecatalog schemaand/or thequeryAPI if you're unfamiliar with the fields in your Lytics account. Keep in mind that everything you see in the Lytics web UI is built off of our APIs. It is never \"necessary\" to use the UI to complete a task with Lytics. If you have the time and resources you can build many different custom applications to interface with your Lytics account through our APIs. We're excited to work with developers to tackle exciting new use cases. If our docs aren't enough you can alwaysreach out to us.",
    "Exploring LQL Queries": "The Browse Queries section in Lytics lets you see the Lytics Query Language (LQL) used in your account. To view this on your Lytics dashboard, navigate toData>Queries. From there, you can click on any item in the table to view an individual LQL file.  This is useful if you need to find out the exact definition of a specific user field and cannot access your LQL directly. Remember that you can't edit or remove LQL from the Lytics UI. For a more detailed breakdown of LQL and how it works, see the full article onQueries & LQL.",
    "Managing LQL Queries": "The Lytics Query Language (LQL) is used to define the transformation of uploaded records and event data intouser fieldson a customer profile. It transforms row-level event data into document-oriented user info. This Query language is similar to the HIVE or SQL query languages. However, it departs from these to offer more of aRich Document(JSON user profile) construction. The following section will explain how to write, validate, and upload queries using LQL.

    "Lytics System Events: Audit Logs and Alerts": "In Lytics, audit logs and system alerts originate from a shared source:Lytics System Events. A System Event is simply a log of an action taken within the platform, whether it\u2019s a user creating a job, segment, or role, or an error message indicating a job failure.",
    "Export vs. Alert": "Log Export: This is a job that either streams logs in real time or performs a batch export to an external source, such as a webhook or a data warehouse table.Log Alert: Alerts are triggered based on specified conditions and notify users when certain actions occur within the system. In both cases, the content of exports or alerts depends on the filters you set up. Filtering is typically done using theSubject(such as User, Segment, or Job) and theVerb(the action taken on the subject, like created, updated, deleted, or failed).",
    "Creating an Audit Log export (aka System Alert) Job via the UI": "Creating a job to export your Audit and System Event logs is like creating any other job; for more information, seeData Pipeline-> Jobs.    In theFilterspanel, simply selectAudit Logsto create an export of your Audit logs or System Events. Depending on yourProvider, you can then select to exportSystem Events. For example, if you selectedGoogle Cloudand you want to export the events toBigQuery. Then, you'd want to select theBigQuery: Export System EventsJob-Type tile.   After choosing the Job-Type, it's like configuring any other export job.  In the case of BigQuery, you can do a one-time or continuous export.",

See thelist of subject types below.Subject ID: identifier of a subject, such as work ID, workflow ID, campaign ID, etc.Verb: action described by the event performed on a subject. See the list of available verbs below.",
    "Job Status Monitoring via Webhooks": "Job-status events can be observed by creating a webhook subscription that POSTs data (or JSON) to a specific URL. These updates, like email alerting and reporting, can be consumed downstream for your monitoring use cases.  Some common examples include listening for audience exports created/updated/deleted or being notified whenever a batch import or export for a given integration fails.",
    "Work related filters": "For events related to the subject typework, the followingverbsmay be emitted: synccomplete- Emitted when a sync operation is completed.updated- Emitted when the job configuration is modified.created- Emitted when a new job is created.deleted- Emitted when a job is terminated.synced- Emitted when the job sync operation completes.completed- Emitted when a job has finished successfully.started- Emitted when a job begins execution.failed- Emitted when a job encounters an error.syncing- Emitted while a job is actively syncing.",
    "Configuration Examples": "The following example shows how to subscribe to multiple event types and send them to a webhook endpoint: You can integrate Lytics system events with Slack using a custom JSON template.

We provide a simple data warehouse on top of Google BigQuery to all of our customers as part of Conductor. Simply reach out to account manager or support for access and information.",
    "How it Works": "Lytics has developed the Cloud Connect product to address this, which serves as a materialized layer atop the cloud warehouse and facilitates direct segmentation and activation. This model allows customers to employ either SQL or AI to craft consumer audiences, which can subsequently be activated downstream. Importantly, this method does not involve long-term data storage within Lytics but instead generates a transient profile context that disappears once the Cloud Connect model is deleted.",
    "Recommend Content Campaign": " The Recommend Content campaign type is used to surface content (an article, a blog post, a product page) to visitors. Each recommendation is personalized to the individual. This could be used to keep visitors engaged by surfacing what to read next, or assist casual perusers by prompting a starting point. Furthermore, the campaign can be configured to only a set of pages or a subset of your total audience. This allows you to limit the recommendations from showing up on auxillary pages like the home page, company page, or checkout page. It can also only be shown to users with high usage. This way low usage visitors can be targeted with a more aggressive campaign.",
    "Build an Audience of High Value Purchasers in Lytics": "For purchase data, this example uses an account that has been connected with Shopify data via Lytics' Shopify import. You may be importing your purchase data to Lytics via some other method such as the Javascript Tag, CSV, or one of our other commerce integrations.

    "Auths": "Some jobs, like specific Webhook flows, don't require explicit credentials to access external systems.  However, most jobs require some form of authorization to retrieve data from or send data to external systems.  In Lytics, these credentials are generically referred to as Authorizations. Authorizations can be managed from theAuth API, or directly from the Lytics interface.  All authorizations are either configuration-based or OAuth-based. Configuration: The authorization is based on credentials provided to Lytics.  These usually take the form of API keys/secrets and usernames/passwords.OAuth: The authorization is given access delegation from an OAuth flow.. Commonly, authorizations will change \u2013 some systems require periodic password changes, tokens get revoked, users who complete OAuth flows leave an organization, etc.  Consequently, a job that is running successfully with authorization today may fail tomorrow if the authorization is no longer valid.  If you know in advance that credentials will update or change, it is recommended that you create a new authorization and update the job to use the new one. To stay alerted on the health status of a job, you can set up alerts as described in theMonitoringsection below.",
    "Configuring and Submitting Jobs": "Jobs can be managed from theJobs API, or directly from the Lytics interface. Each job has custom configuration options that tell the job when to run, what type of data to pull, which lists to pull data from in external systems, how to send the data to downstream sources, etc.  Each job's API endpoint will validate the presence of any required parameters, or other conditions that must be satisfied for the job to run correctly.  In the event of a validation error in the job configuration, the API will return a 400 error with a message indicating what is misconfigured. If the configuration for the job request is valid, the job will be immediately submitted to Lytics internal job running system.",
    "Job State Machine": "Jobs running on Lytics' internal job running system may be in any of the following states: Runnable: The job is currently running.Completed: The job has run successfully and is not scheduled to re-run.Paused: The job has been manually paused, and will remain so until it is unpaused or terminated.Sleeping: The job is in between runs and is scheduled to run again at a later point in time.Failed: The job has exceeded its retry limit and will not attempt to run again.Terminated: The job has been manually terminated and will not attempt to run again. Jobs will usually first enter into a Runnable state.  If the job is fed input from real-time triggers, it will stay running unless it encounters any errors.  If the job runs on a batched interval, it will usually switch between Runnable and Sleeping.  While most transitions happen automatically in the system (Runnable \u2192 Completed, for example), some are triggered manually, namely:",
    "Errors": "There are a variety of reasons a job will enter a Failed state, including: Authorization issues: This is the most common reason for job failures.  Some authorizations can become invalid if the external system requires periodic password changes and the authorization isn't updated, if tokens get revoked, or if users who complete OAuth flows leave an organization and the token no longer has access to the resources it is requesting.External failures: Sometimes external systems can produce intermittent failures, like HTTP 503 errors if the system is temporarily unavailable.  Because of their intermittency, it's less likely that one of these errors will result in a job ending in a Failed state.Internal Lytics failures: While rare, sometimes the availability of internal Lytics resources can cause a job to fail.  Because of the high availability of Lytics systems (>99.9%), it's unlikely that a job will be in a Failed state from Lytics internals. When an error occurs, the job will enter a Sleeping state, and retry a minute later.  If an error occurs on the second attempted run, the job will sleep double the amount of time as the previous run.  If errors still occur after two hours, the job will enter a Failed state. Any failed work can be manually restarted, through the Job API or through the Lytics interface.  If, for example, a job is in a failed state because of an authorization issue, you can create a new authorization for the job and restart it.",
    "Contributing": "Many jobs are maintained by Lytics, and even more workflows can be enabled by using our generic tooling for Webhook and SFTP-based integration flows. Some jobs are open-sourced and run on Conductor's Opus framework for running jobs. Check out ourConductor Opus Template on GiHubto get started creating your own jobs.",
    "Label": "Create a label for your authorization. This will only be surfaced in the Lytics UI for easy navigation when selecting the authorization in additional workflows or reviewing the details and logs. ",
    "Description": "Add an optional description to provide context for where the auth came from and how it will be used. ",
    "Token URL": "Ansira will provide the token URL. This is the endpoint used to get a token. In most cases, your specific instance information will replace the XXXX in the example. ",
    "Client ID": "Enter the provided Client ID from Ansira. ",
    "Client Secret": "Enter the provided Client Secret from Ansira. ",
    "Additional Request Parameters": "Lastly, since the Ansira API expects an access token as part of the request, we must configure the additional parameters to include the token generated via OAuth, as described below. ",
    "Audience": "This integration works by ensuring every member of an audience has been enriched with Ansira data. In most cases, the desired outcome is matching a UUID or Ansira-specific identifier with an email address. Though the source audience is ultimately up to each customer's discretion, we recommend keeping the following in mind: Every user entering the audience will receive an API call to Ansira. This may impact limits and cost, so one general rule of thumb is to define your source audience by highlighting that the desired data is missing and should only be enriched when the prerequisites are met.For example:If I am collecting email addresses from a web form and I want to be sure that every known user with an email address also has an Ansira UUID, I would define my source audience as all users with an email address and no UUID. This ensures we only make calls for users with an email that has not been enriched.",

    "Configure Enrichment Webhook": "In the final step, we will bring it all together by configuring our webhook destination to use the auth, template, and audience to enrich a Lytics profile.",
    "Testing the Personalized Widget": "Testing widgets that contain user profile fields can be tricky. If you are using the Pathfora SDK, it may help to use thepathfora.customDataobjectto simulate the user field data during the development process. Alternatively, add theoffer_codefield to your current profile by sending an API request to the data stream which contains the raw data for the field with the appropriate identifier (usually_uid). You can use thejstag.getid()function in the developer console of your website which has the Lytics JStag loaded to get your_uid. Here is an example API call to add theoffer_codefield via thedefaultstream. This example makes a request to the Lytics collector API for your account. Ifoffer_codeis mapped in the LQL for the streamdefault, and_uidis a unique identifier for the stream, it should add the valueFREE324234234to the user profile. Once you see it show up in your user profile in the Lytics UI, refresh your website to ensure that the widget is populated with the new field value. ",

    "Export Audiences to Lotame": "Sending audience membership to Lotame requires some coordination between Lytics and Lotame. Lotame can receive audience membership data in various services. This integration chooses to send audience membership data to a Lytics-managed SFTP server. Lotame will be able to access the SFTP folder.",
    "Goals": "Lytics Goals allow you to guide users through highly personalized experiences that increase customer lifetime value and drive progress towards your primary business goals. You will use the Lytics Canvas to create, edit, and monitor your Goals. Navigate toGoalsand clickNew Goalin the top right of your screen to create a new one.",
    "Choose an audience": "The first step in configuring a Goal is picking your starting audience. Select this audience by clicking the \"Audience\" button (blue circle) on the left-hand side of the Lytics Canvas. You can choose an existing audience or you can build a new one by clickingNew audience.  Lytics recommends keeping this starting audience as broad as possible, as there will be ample opportunity to add filters and refine your targeting through Stages and Experiences.",
    "Stages": "Stages are the individual steps that move customers towards your Goal. Users in your overall audience will automatically enter the first Stage. When a user completes the first conversion event, they will move to the second Stage, and so on through the last Stage within your Goal. A user can only be in one Stage at a time. ",
    "Moving through Conversion Events": "Users move to the next Stage when they complete the selected conversion event. Goals are always configured so that users move through your Stages from left-to-right as they complete conversion events. Keep in mind that users don't always complete conversion events in the order anticipated, which means they may end up skipping a Stage. If you want to prevent this, you can include additional logic in your conversion event definition. And remember, users can never be in more than one Stage per Goal at a time.",
    "Experience Drawer": "The Experience drawer contains Experience templates and Experiences that aren't part of a Goal yet. Add any of these to your Goal by dragging them into a Stage. Open the drawer by clicking the icons labeledExperience templateorExperience.  If you drag an Experience that is activated into your Goal, you will need to pause it before being able to save your Goal. You can do so from the Lytics Canvas by hovering over the Experience card and then clicking thePausebutton.  Once you're ready to reactivate the Experience in the context of the Goal, clickResume.",
    "Prioritizing Goals": " Much like prioritizing Experiences within Stages, you can also prioritize Goals. Since membership is not mutually exclusive (that is, users can be moving towards multiple Goals at a time), it is possible that a user will be eligible for two simultaneous Experiences from two different Goals. When that happens, Lytics will take into account Goal priority when determining which Experience will be delivered. The higher on the Goal list, the higher the priority.",
    "Conversion events": "Conversion events within Lytics are behavior-based audiences such as purchasers, highly engaged users, known users, etc. These determine which users are eligible for the Experiences within a Stage. When a user fulfills conversion event applied to a Stage, they move to the next Stage until they reach the last conversion event for that Goal. If users have completed the conversion event applied to a Stage, theywill notbe eligible for any of the Experiences in the Stage. This prevents overlapping targeting such as continuing to show a Facebook ad to a user who has already converted on a particular campaign.  To assign a conversion event to a Stage, click the \u201cTrophy\u201d icon to open a menu of available conversion events. A red dot next to the \u201cTrophy\u201d icon indicates a Stage that still needs to be assigned a conversion event. A conversion event is required to populate the metrics for a Stage.",
    "Stage metrics": "Lytics tracks three key metrics to measure Stage performance:Potential reach,Converted, andConversion rate. The table below defines these metrics and how often they are updated in the Lytics UI.",
    "Adding and rearranging Experiences": "Experiences can be added to a Stage in several ways. You can add an Experience directly to a Stage by clickingAdd a new Experiencealong the bottom of a Stage.You can drag an Experience template into a Stage, which will create an Experience with boilerplate settings to use as a starting point. You can also drag an existing Experience into a Stage, either from another Stage or from the Experience drawer. Note:This will significantly change the audience for that Experience.",
    "Prioritizing Experiences": "To ensure that your audience receives the right amount of messaging, each user will only be eligible for one Experience per Stage at a time. That means that no matter how many web modals you add to a Stage, your audience members will only see one at a time. Lytics won't just choose one at random though; there is a sophisticated decision engine that determines which Experience will be delivered to the end user. Part of the input into that engine is the order of Experiences within a Stage. The closer to the top of a Stage an Experience is, the more likely it is that it will be delivered to the end user.",
    "Goal Canvas Audiences": "You can think of the Lytics Canvas as an intelligent audience builder. When you create new Stages and add conversion events, you are effectively building new audiences based on the desired flow of users towards achieving your Goal. Unlike drip campaigns or more traditional journey builders, Lytics doesn't require you to build complicated audiences. Keep them simple, and the Lytics Canvas will do the heavy lifting for you.",
    "Selecting audiences for your Goals": "The following tips will assist you when building and selecting audiences for the conversion events and Experiences within your Goals.",
    "Building block audiences": "When you\u2019re creating audiences to use in a Goal, it\u2019s helpful to think about each audience as a \"building block\" rather than a complete definition of who you want to be targeting. Below are examples of good building block audiences: All users Users who have shared their email address Users who have purchased something",
    "Excluding users": "Building block audiences work best when they don\u2019t exclude anyone. It can be tempting to try to exclude users from a building block audience \u2014 for example, excluding \u201cKnown Users\u201d from \u201cAll\u201d in order to target only anonymous users \u2014 but the Lytics Canvas will do this for you automatically if one of your future conversion events is the audience \"Known Users\". NOTE:If you do end up doing this yourself, you can create a \u201cdead-end\u201d path, where users are unable to progress due to the definition of the automatically generated audiences, which are explained in more detail below. There is one important exception to this rule.If you want tosuppressa subset of your entire audience from your Goal, you can exclude them from your \"overall audience\". This will work so long as the exclusion rule isnotrelated to the downstream conversion events. An \u201coverall audience\u201d is the first audience you select on the Lytics Canvas, which is represented by the left-most blue circle as shown below. For example, if you used the audience below as your overall audience, you would exclude \"Realtors\" from the entire Goal. This will not create a \"dead-end\" if none of the subsequent Stages have conversion events dependent on the \"Realtors\" criteria. All users, excluding Realtors",
    "Filter audiences": "If you want to target with more granularity than a Stage audience allows, you can add a filter on individual Experiences within a Stage.  This is a great point to target users based on behavior, such as engagement level. The audience you choose here will be added to your Stage audience with an \"AND\" statement.",
    "Experience conversions": "A common pattern may be that you want any users who converted on the Experiences in your Stage to enter the next Stage. Learn how to target users based on Experience interactions to build a conversion event like this.",
    "How audiences are used in the Canvas": "Now that you've learned how to select and build audiences, take a deeper look into how the Lytics Canvas uses these audiences to help users flow towards your Goal.",
    "Automatically generated audiences": "The Lytics Canvas automatically generates audiences based on your selected conversion events. For example, let's say you want to create a the first Stage to target users who haven\u2019t shared their email address, and the second Stage will target known users who haven\u2019t purchased yet. Even though you haven\u2019t explicitly created an audience for users who haven\u2019t shared their email, or users who haven\u2019t purchased, Lytics will create these audiences for you. This example would look as follows in the UI: The following graphic shows how the Lytics Canvas takes your simple building blocks and creates more refined audiences.See the full size diagram. Remember, if you exclude converted users on a building block audience, it can cause problems and prevent users from moving between Stages. Let the Lytics Canvas do the work for you!",
    "Mutually exclusivity": "Stage audiences aremutually exclusive, meaning a user can only be in one Stage at a time. This is a result of the automatic audience building done by the Lytics Canvas. If a user in \u201cUnknown Users\u201d shares their email and now qualifies for \u201cKnown users\u201d they will automatically move into that Stage without any manual intervention.",
    "Goal Intelligence": "The Goal Intelligence Report provides a holistic view of how your existing campaigns are contributing towards the marketing goal you selected during the onboarding process. This report will help you answer questions about how effectively your marketing campaigns are driving conversions, how many engaged customers you have, and whether you are producing the right content for your users. The Goal Intelligence Report contains modules that focus on answering a specific marketing question. Each module is described below, along with definitions for the associated metrics and how often they are updated. ",
    "Goal Progress": "The Goal Progres module contains three top-level metrics for the campaigns you\u2019ve imported into Lytics. Use this summary to measure how your campaigns are working together to achieve your goal.",
    "Connected Customers": "Connected Customers represent the number of active users who are engaged with your brand across multiple channels. This is a Lytics proprietary KPI that offers a quick and comprehensive understanding of the performance of your account\u2019s identity resolution strategy. Lytics defines a Connected Customer as a user who has: Activity data collected from 2 or more channels, including web, email, or mobile.A positive and increasing Momentum Score, which represents the rate at which users are interacting with your brand. You can find the Connected Customer KPI in the Goal Intelligence Report. These  metrics come from a Lytics audience that is automatically generated under-the-hood using the criteria described above. ",
    "Content Classification": "The Content Classification module shows a list of the topics, documents, and relevance scores for the content used across your connected channels. Lytics automatically analyzes the topics within your website content and determines user-level affinities for those topics, which can help you decide what content to produce. Use these metrics to ensure you are creating the right content to engage your target audience.",
    "Why is this KPI important?": "Connected Customers are valuable to your business. This KPI helps you understand how many Connected Customers you have and the impact of your marketing programs on user engagement. Lytics helps you gain more Connected Customers by refining your audience targeting and messaging strategies to improve engagement and ultimately increase the ROI for your marketing efforts.",
    "What can I do with it?": "Track your Connected Customers for a pulse on engagement levels across your active campaigns.

    "Identify Key Topics": "The Lyticscontent affinity enginebuilds atopic taxonomyfrom content on your website. Lytics will use this taxonomy and user activity data to determine a user's affinity for a topic. These content affinity scores are available in the audience builder, and will be core to building your target audience. Select the piece of content you wish to promote. Then take some time to familiarize yourself with the topics in your Lytics account and try to identify the Lytics topics that are relevant to your content. You can sort by the average level of affinity on the topic list view to ensure you are using a popular topic for targeting criteria. You may choose one or more of these topics to include in anAffinity, which you can then use to create audiences. Clicking on a topic displays a summary page which shows a full distribution of user interest. ",
    "Build an Audience Using Content Affinity": "For most marketing use cases, it's useful to target users based on their interests in a group of related topics. For this reason, Lytics enables you to create your own, brand-specific Affinities. You can also target users based on their interest in an individual topic. See ourAudience Builder documentationfor more information. Once you have your Affinity rules included, verify that the user count of your audience looks correct. If you plan to use this as a source audience for a lookalike, Facebook expects anywhere from1,000 to 50,000 users. For a simple retargeting audience, you'll want to reach a broad number of users. You may adjust the sliders on your affinity rules accordingly.",

    "Custom Data Sources": "Lytics can onboard and process data from custom data sources, helping to build out furtherUser Profileswith data specific to your company. Custom data is often the most valuable for your marketing efforts as itallows you to personalize web experiences and build meaningful audiences using data unique to your users.",
    "Onboarding process": "Unlike data collected from web activity and integrated marketing tools which automatically map data to Lytics user fields, custom data sources require an evaluation, planning, and implementation process. The Lytics team will assist in identifying use cases and the data fields needed to achieve them. Our CE team will then produce a data dictionary that describes the structure, format, location and relationship of your data. The data dictionary is used to writequerieswhich map custom data fields to Lytics user fields as it is ingested. Finally your custom data is uploaded to the Lytics and made available for use to build audiences, personalize web experiences, or export to marketing tools.",
    "Uploading custom data": "Data can be uploaded to Lytics via CSV SFTP upload or ourcollection APIs. Lytics can ingest both large, bulk uploads of user data and smaller, real-time uploads of event data. Before uploading data to Lytics, ensure all necessary LQL queries are in place or it will not be mapped to Lytics user fields, preventing identity resolution. When considering large uploads to the Lytics platform, be aware that this may cause an event backlog on your account. This occurs as our platform queues incoming information as it processes the content of the upload. Processing begins when the upload completes and can last considerably longer than the initial upload. This can result in a delay in seeing information from other sources in your account as well as delays in any outbound, trigger-based workflows.",
    "Custom Data Ingestion": "Getting your custom data ready to be properly ingested is crucial during your onboarding process with Lytics. This document gives an overview of the formatting requirements for custom data sources sent to Lytics via batch CSV or JSON, utilizingS3orSFTPimport workflows, as well as batch or real-time imports using ourcollection APIs. File namingFile compressionField formattingHeadersTimestampsJSON formatting",
    "File naming": "When you have a recurring bulk import, fromS3orSFTPfor example, you must consistently follow naming conventions to ensure your data is ingested and displayed correctly. Keep file naming consistent by determining casing and spacing.E.g. all lower-case, use underscores for spaces:file_source_1_date.Name each successive file with an identical 'root' along with a time-based suffix such asYYYYMMDDinfiletitle-20191119.csvor a UNIX timestampfiletitle-1678297720.tab.Lytics will import files that match the 'root' filename and will use the modified timestamp of the file to determine the order to import files and to determine which new files to import for continuous imports.",
    "File compression": "If needed, files may be compressed using the zip format prior to ingestion. The zip file will be decompressed and deleted after the content has been ingestied.",
    "Field formatting": "Phone numbers should be standardized. Lytics suggests normalizing phone numbers in a format such as12223334444.Omit double quotes or escape quotes.Omit newlines.Keep all free form text in quotes if possible.Avoid page breaks or special characters. For more, reference thebasic rulesfor CSV files.",
    "Headers": "Keep headers consistent across your organization and your vendors by determining casing and spacing.Column headers have to match the sample file exactly.When adding a new source, review current mappings and headers to determine if any headers need to be mapped or consolidated into the same field in Lytics.E.g. if the fieldmobilecomes in from source A, and the fieldcellcomes in from source B, it\u2019s likely these should be mapped to the same Lytics field, which will require anLQLmodification.",
    "Timestamps": "Lytics is able to ingest data in a different order than the events described in that data transpired. For this to work, individual JSON or CSV records must have a timestamp associated with them. For workflow-based imports, select the key/column which contains the event timestamp when import workflows are configured. For Collection API imports, use the timestamp field URL parameter. When Lytics looks for new files, it will choose first based on the file'slast modified date. If multiple files have the same last modified date, the date stamp in the file name is used to select the next file to import.",
    "JSON formatting": "JSON file formatting varies slightly depending on the method and nature of the data to import. See examples for bulk and real-time imports below.",
    "Bulk": "Files imported via S3, SFTP, or bulk collection should benewline delimited, meaning each object represents a single record/event, and there is a newline separating them.",
    "What is lead capture?": "Traditionally, lead capture involves gathering information from individuals interested in your products or services, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. This occurs when people visit your website, subscribe to your newsletter, download resources, or interact with your content. However, in recent years, the role of lead capture within your global consumer engagement strategy has undergone significant transformation.",
    "Activate Required Attributes": "As an admin user of Lytics, you canenable or disable any attributesfrom being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case. Required Attributes:",
    "Bonus Idea": "You can extend this use case to progressively improve your visitor profiles by surfacing data capture forms specific to gaps in their profile data. For instance, when they are unknown, only ask for email. As soon as you have an email, perhaps you want to know more about their preferences or learn how to improve a particular portion of your product/offering.",
    "Configure Reporting": "The Lytics platform has a pre-defined schema to facilitate this use case. As such, we recommend building acustom reportfrom within our UI to showcase your progress in converting unknown or anonymous visitors to known visitors with a strong identifier. There are many ways to configure this type of reporting, but here we'll guide you through a basic example to measure impact. ",
    "Add Anonymous vs. Known \"Size\" Component": "Step 1:Once you have created your new report, add a component using the \"+ Add New Component\" button at the top of the report. Step 2:Select \"Size\" as your component type. Step 3:Name your component. We recommend something simple like \"Anonymous vs. Known\". Step 4:Add an optional description to explain the goal of this report to ease the consumption for others later. Step 5:Select the audiences you'd like to highlight. In this use case, we'll select \"Anonymous Profiles\" and \"Known Profiles\", which are both available by default. Step 6:Save your component. Please note it may take some time for the report to populate once you have configured it, but as long as you see the empty \"Not enough data\" state, you are good to go.",
    "Add Impression \"Composition\" Component": "Step 1:Following steps similar to the previous component, we'll add another component, but this time, we use the \"Composition\" component type. Step 2:Name your component \"Campaign Impressions,\" as this component will focus on showcasing impression information to validate that the campaign is being shown. Step 3:Select the \"All\" audience to ensure all visitors, regardless if they are known or unknown, are included in the report. Step 4:Select the field \"ly_impressions.\" This field represents an array of all campaigns each visitor has interacted with and is available by default. The values returned for custom campaigns will match the \"ID\" you set above in the campaign configuration. Step 5:Finally, replace \"my_campaign_id\" in the example below with the ID of your campaign above to highlight only interactions for that campaign.",
    "Add Conversion \"Composition\" Component": "Following the same steps as above, configure another \"Composition\" component, but this time, use the field \"ly_conversions\" as it will be an array of all campaigns your users have converted on instead of the impressions used previously. Thats it. Your report has been configured. As you begin to gain impressions and conversions, this report will populate. Generally, every hour or two, to highlight the impact.",
    "Bonus!": "Get additional guidance on how to pass interaction information related to your campaign to the following common sources for additional reporting and insight discovery: Google Analytics [coming soon]Custom BI via Data Warehouse [coming soon]",
    "Execute Your Experience": "Once you have configured and tested your Experience, activation is as simple as publishing the JavaScript code to your site. This may be done via a tag manager like Google Tag Manager or using another mechanism such as Drupal blocks or WordPress.",
    "Message format for Subscription Events": "When a user profile is updated, it may be due to: A new data event.Scoring gets updated ocassionally.A scheduled trigger evaluation. A trigger of \"has not logged in last 7 days\" may get scheduled to be evaluated 7 days after last x event. When the user gets updated, segment membership is reevaluated and segmentsa user has moved into or out of triggers a message. Here is an example of the message that is produced.",
    "Import Webhook Events": "In order to import data from Customer.io, you need to setup the webhook to send event data to Lytics.

    "Export Audiences (SFTP)": "Exporting user profiles and audience membership to LiveRamp allows you use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics combined with LiveRamp's identity resolution to fine-tune your targeting. Export your audience to an SFTP server in a LiveRamp CSV format. Use SFTP to stage your files before importing into LiveRamp.",
    "Single Send Tactics": "When you activate this Experience, users will be pushed to a SendGrid contact list, and a segment will be created for the Experience in SendGrid. Ensure that a new segment was created and populated in your SendGrid account. Navigate toMarketing > Contacts. (If you have the legacy marketing campaigns enabled use the Marketing tab that is marked asNEW).You should see a new segment under the list you selected during configuration.

    "Types of partners:": "Subcontractor Implementations- A partner who implements a Lytics customer that has been acquired directly by Lytics.Subcontract Technical Account Management- A partner who helps aid a Lytics-acquired customer with technical management and strategy components as an extension of professional services.Referral Partner (Enterprise or Mid-Market)- Under a reseller agreement partners can bring their customers to Lytics to be supported by licensing and provide implementation or technical account management services at their discretion. Partners interested in becoming resellers and who do not have an agreement with Lytics can contact the Lytics commercial team to create one.",
    "Build a Predictive Audience in Lytics": "There are several ways to build your audience in Lytics that you can utilize in your ad platform for targeting. To begin testing this strategy, Lytics recommends defining and building the deterministic rule for who you\u2019d like to retarget in your ad strategy. This most commonly looks like: \u201cHas done event X but not Y.\u201d\u201cHas web activity but is not a paying subscriber.\u201d It\u2019s likely that you have rules like this already set up in your ad tools. To improve the performance metrics of these campaigns, you can use Lytics to decrease the overall audience size available for targeting but increase the likelihood of conversion against your business goal. This will impact your ad KPIs by potentially decreasing the total number of unique impressions but increasing conversion rate and/or decreasing cost per acquisition. To do this, layer in one of the Lytics out-of-the-boxbehavioral audiencesthat use data science, such asEngagement: Deeply Engaged Users. *This rule set includes all deeply engaged users who haven\u2019t made a purchase.  By passing this audience directly into an ad channel, your remarketing efforts will be more refined to only include users who are deeply engaged and more likely to convert than your total user base.",
    "Leverage Content Affinity in Audiences": "Lytics can also create data-science based audiences specific to a topic of interest for an individual user. This logic is more robust than retargeting users around a site category that they have shown past interest in because it evaluates changes in topics in real-time and assesses a user\u2019s interest in a topic in relation to all existing users within your account and their actions. Read more aboutuser-level topic affinities here. You can utilize acontent-affinity audiencefor remarketing as a single rule for an audience, or as part of a rule set as demonstrated below. This rule set includes users with a high affinity for \u2018Chicken\u2019 and who have their membership on pause. By using content affinity-based audiences for remarketing in ad channels, your ad copy and creative can be strategically paired to be more relevant to your customers based on what they have previously shown an interest in.",
    "Custom Predictive Audiences": "The last strategy for predictive audiences within Lytics is to rely on our proprietarySegmentMLproduct to do lookalike modeling across your own first-party data. Most advertisers are familiar with lookalike modeling within ad channels to extend your reach. You can also mine your own first-party data for more relevant lookalikes to offer your products and services to within an ad channel. Your Lytics Account Manager or Services team can help you create predictive audiences within your account, which can then be exported into downstream ad tools the same way as any other audience built within Lytics. See theIntegrations documentationfor provider-specific information.  This summary report shows the growth of a custom predictive audience over a week. While these audiences may be smaller than the lookalikes you\u2019ll get back fromFacebookorGoogle Adsdirectly, because these users have interacted with your brand previously, and are showing signals towards behaving like your seed audience, they will have a higher conversion rate that can be influenced by additional ad campaigns with the right strategy and messaging.",
    "Available Segments (Audiences)": "The following audience segments are all available out of the box, with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers.",
    "\ud83d\udc4d": "If you haven't already reviewed ourdocumentation on collecting eventsvia our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected.",
    "Consuming Metrics Downstream": "Once you have connected Lytics to your monitoring tool, there are various ways you can apply metrics from Lytics to support your operational and IT audit processes. Below are a few examples: Active monitoring - defined by alerting, requires additional configuration within your downstream tools to monitor Lytics.On-call distribution lists - control who within your operational teams to inform.Quiet hours - manage within a tool where you are already doing that for other metrics.Correlation of metrics - show existing metrics (e.g., website performance) in the context of Lytics metrics.Operational users - watch for signals without creating a Lytics admin user account.Anomaly detection - use threshold-based alerts that most monitoring tools have that go beyond the capabilities Lytics provides natively.",
    "Platform Monitoring via Metric API": "The Metric API provides access to a variety of metrics that are recorded in the Lytics platform. This API allows you to access segment size metrics, events received per hour, and many workflow-specific metrics. Heartbeats: metrics with a value of 1 for \"up & healthy\" and 0 for \"not healthy\" (or missing). *Availability of Metrics: the Lytics Metric API and all Lytics export workflows run inside Lytics' work runtime system in Kubernetes. During deploys or scaling events, these processes can move between servers, potentially resulting in 1 or 2-minute gaps in metrics. Therefore, alerts on single heartbeat misses are not recommended. Instead, look for a missing window of 5.",
    "Slack: Alerts": "Monitor jobs, authorizations, audiences, and queries in your Lytics instance with real-time alerts to a Slack channel",
    "Slack: Event Quota Alerts": "Monitor the event quota in your Lytics instance with real-time alerts to a Slack channel.",
    "Find a user": "There are a number of circumstances where you may need to search for a user. For example, you built a \u201ctest\u201d user to validate a campaign is working correctly, you want to see how your marketing efforts are influencing individual user's behavior, or you need to view/delete a profile for GDPR compliance. Follow these steps to search for a user profile in Lytics: In the app, selectAudiencesfrom the navigation menuSelectFind a userfrom the expanded menuSelect the field you would like to search with from the drop-down menu. By default,Emailis selected.In theSearchbox, enter the email address (or selected search term) of interest. If you find multiple profiles for a single email (or any other identifier), this may indicate data fragments haven't been merged together yet or that your identity resolution strategy is not configured correctly. Please contactLytics Supportfor assistance.",
    "Custom Image Approach": "There are three ways you might approach adding an image to a web Experience or Pathfora widget: Setting a background image with custom CSS.Using thenatively supported image featurewith some custom CSS to adjust the size and placement of the image relative to the text of the widget.Adding an image via inline HTML to the message or headline field. This guide will discuss the implementation of options 2 and 3. Note that option 3 is only available for widgets built directly through the SDK. Inlineimgelements can not be added in theLytics Experience editor.",
    "Using the Default Image Feature": "To use the native image capability in Pathfora, simply add thevariantandimagesettings to a basic widget configuration to get started. This config will generate a simple slideout, with a headline, message and CTA, and a small, circular image above the text.  Adding an image in this way is natively supported for web Experiences in thedesign stepof the editor.",
    "Using an Inline Image": "You could also present an image within the text content of the widget by adding animgHTML element in the headline or message of the widget: You may want to add a custom class name to this element to help style it with CSS later. Note:As mentioned above using HTML inline images in this manor is not compatible withweb Experiencescreated through the Lytics UI, not even withAPI overrides. This approach only works if you are implementing widgets with the SDK directly. The complete code example in this guide will contain both a large feature image using the native Pathfora setting, and a small inline image. ",
    "Styling the Image Slideout": "With some additional CSS work, you can style images of both types to fit the slideout.",
    "Styling the Default Image Setting": "The image generated by theimagesetting in the config has the class namepf-widget-img. In the CSS, to select this element you will also need an additional level of specificity to ensure that your styles will override the default Pathfora styles for images. The example below specifies thepf-widget-variant-2class name in addition the the standard custom class name of your widget. These styles make the image span the full width of the widget, and position it at the top. Next you can adjust the text to appear below the image, by applying a margin to the headline. Remember that CSS specificity may be important here as well. Lastly, we'll need to adjust the \"x\" button in the corner of the modal to display prominently above the image. ",
    "Styling an Inline Image": "Now to style the inline image, select the custom class name you defined. The example in this guide floats the image left of the text of the widget:  Remember you candownload the code for this exampleto get the completed JavaScript and CSS. This can act as a starting point for your own custom image widget.",
    "Defining the Lytics Audience": "The example widget in this guide will be targeted at an audience of anonymous users with ahigh intensity. Remember toupdate your config with the audience slugyou wish to serve the widget to. Alternatively, you may build your widget as aweb personalize Experiencewith theCapture Leadstactic in the Lytics UI and apply theformElementssetting with an API override.",
    "Downloading a Customer Profile": "GDPRrequires the right of access and data portability. You can use the Lytics platform to download a JSON file of a customer's profile. You can also use the Lytics API to download a customer profile. Log into yourLytics account.ClickAudience>Find a user.Select the field you would like to search on from the drop-down menu. By default,Emailis selected.In theSearchbox, please enter the email address (or selected search term) of the customer who has requested their profile.Select the desired customer from the results list.ClickDownload profile. You will receive a success message andprofile.jsonwill begin to download.",
    "Deleting a Customer Profile": "TheGDPRandCCPArequirements grant the user in scope to request the removal of their personal data without undue delay. This guide provides instructions on how to delete a profile from Lytics via the Lytics UI. In addition, you can use the Lytics API to delete a customer profile. A successful deletion request of a profile using the Lytics APIwill notupdate the status of a customer in the Lytics UI until the profile has been removed from Lytics.  The removal is handled in background batch processes that will be fulfilled within 14 days. Log into yourLytics account.ClickAudience>Find a user.Select the field you would like to search from the drop-down menu.

    "Benefits": "Events are delivered to Lytics in real-time.Reduces the number of SDKs installed.Leverages Google-managed SDKs to streamline app approval.Easy access to advanced testing and debugging tools.Automatically passes events to Google Analytics or analysis or further delivery to BigQuery.",
    "Install Firebase SDK": "This solution leveragesFirebase Analyticswhich Google Analytics powers under the hood. This means that in addition to getting data delivered to Lytics, you\u2019ll also be able to leverage Google Analytics and its direct integrations to other Google products such as BigQuery as an automatic value add. Google providesthorough documentationfor getting a Firebase project set up and installed in your platform of choice. Once you have completed the setup and made it to theStart logging eventssection of the documentation, you are ready to move to the next step. Feel free to log some sample events per the documentation, either way, we\u2019ll come back here further down in this tutorial.",
    "Install Google Tag Manager SDK": "Next, we\u2019ll leverage Google Tag Manager, which offers seamless integration with Firebase Analytics to forward events collected by Firebase to Lytics. Like Firebase, Google hasexcellent documentationfor getting a Google Tag Manager account set up and the iOS or Android SDKs configured.",
    "Sending User Properties & Events": "Now that we have configured Firebase and Google Tag Manager, we are ready to start configuring and sending our events. Firebase makes both setting user properties as well as passing interaction-based events easy. For more details on the power of Firebase, you can revisit theStart Logging Eventssection of the getting started documentation. The above represents an example of a custom event nameddid_something. For that event, we also include two parameters_uidandlytics_test_key. These parameters are entirely up to you and should be in support of your use case. Keep a record of the parameters used, as you will need to explicitly define those in Google Tag Manager to pass them to Lytics. That said, including an identifier of some for every event is essential to your identity resolution strategy. In the above example, we use_uid, which is one of the default identifiers. Consult your account manager or solutions team for the optimal approach here. Regardless of the approach, it is essential that the ID(s) passed persist. There are various ways to generate and store a value on the device. For this step, it is best to consult your app development team. One example would be to use Swift'sUUIDto generate a unique user identifier and store it usingUserDefaults. The method used to generate, store, and access this value has no impact on the results. It is only essential to include that value in all events and have it persist for as long as possible. On that note, whenever possible, it is a best practice to include multiple identifiers such as email, or IDFA, to maximize the match rate.",
    "Configuring Google Tag Manager for Event Forwarding": "The final step in getting user details from your app to Lytics is configuring your Google Tag Manager Container. We\u2019ll start by definingVariablesfor each of the parameters you pass in your events from your app. Based on our example, we\u2019ll define two variables: _uid and lytics_test_key.",
    "Step One": "From the Google Tag Manager dashboard, navigate toVariablesin the left-hand menu.",
    "Step Two": "Create a new variable, one for each parameter, using theNewbutton. In the new window that loads, clickChoose a variabletype and selectEvent Parameter. This is just an example, you can use any variable type based on your needs.Event Namemay also prove helpful in adding more context to the event data delivered to Lytics.",
    "Step Three": "Finish your variable configuration by selectingCustom Parameter, followed by inputting one of the parameter names we defined above. In our case, we\u2019ll use_uidwith a default value of an empty string. Save your settings and move to the next parameter until you have created a variable for all parameters being passed to Lytics.",
    "Step Four": "With your variables defined, we\u2019ll move on to creating a newTagwithin our container. SelectTagsfrom the left-hand menu andNewtag once the list of tags has loaded. On the following window, clickChoose a tag typeand selectCustom Image.",
    "Step Five": "With your tag type selected, we\u2019ll configure theImage URLas well as theTriggeringrules. The Image URL will leverage theLytics Image Pixelcollection method. To configure, you\u2019ll need to know yourAccount ID. For simplicity, we\u2019ll break the full URL into two parts that will be joined together in actual execution. Focusing first on the path, everything fromhttpsup to the?you will need to replace theYOUR-AIDportion of the path with your actualaccount IDand theSTREAMportion of the path to your desired ingest stream. The query parameters will contain the field name you\u2019d like to pass to Lytics, as well as a value that is populated by referencing the GTM variables. Putting those two parts together results in the final value of theImage URLin our config. Last we\u2019ll configure the event that triggers our forward by selectingAll Events.",
    "Step Six": "With our tag defined, the final step is publishing the Google Tag Manager container and storing the config that is generated in the proper directory of our App. Once again,Google provides instructionsfor doing so.",
    "Test & Debug Implementation": "With our implementation all configured, the final step is to test and debug. Each of the steps defined above supports testing and debugging. We\u2019ve added quick links to those resources below. Firebase Event DebuggerGoogle Tag Manager DebuggerLytics Data Streams: Once successfully tested, you can do the final validation by reviewing your incoming data as part of thestreamsUI within your Lytics account.",
    "Web Personalization Campaign Reporting": " The campaign report is the control center for a published campaign. Here, you can find out how the campaignis doing, find out what kind of campaign it is, edit the campaign, pause the campaign, or duplicate the campaign. When you publish a campaign, Lytics begins reporting on conversations and reach, and tracks the conversionrate of a campaign over time. If you have create a two variations of your widget, the conversions and reachwill be tracked separately for each variation. Conversions are defined a little differently for each campaign type. Here are the definitions for each campaign type: Content Promotion: User clicks through to the promoted content.CTA: User clicks on the CTA.Lead Gen: User submits lead gen form.Present a message: No conversion. In addition to real time reporting data, the campaign report includes information about the type of campaignbeing run, the appearance of the widget, the event history, and recently converted users.",
    "Content Curation": "Content curation on Lytics involves scanning your website and other content to ingest topics and build content affinities. Properly setting up the curation process is key to enabling use cases such as promoting relevant ads and delivering targeted web content. This document gives an overview of important concepts and considerations to make while curating your content during the early stages of implementation. It will also help determine if any custom content curation should be planned for. Ensure that any content customization is performed to support your campaign execution and audience building, not for the sake of customization itself.",
    "What domains should Lytics scan?": "By default, Lytics will scan all content on your domains. You can specify which domains Lytics will scan by adding domains to the \"Domain Allowlist\", which can be modified by navigating toAccount Settings > Content. If there are only certain sections of your website Lytics should be scanning, you can customize by allowing or blocking specific paths as well. For example, if you have a blog section and other pages won\u2019t be relevant to gauge what users are interested in, you can add the path/blog/to the list of allowed paths. You can see which domains have been improved in the domain and path settings on the Content Classification page. Visit the content account settings documentation for detailed instructions on how to add more domains or paths.",
    "Are there any paths that should be avoided?": "A website may have sections that should not be scanned for topics such as password reset pages or any pages hidden behind a log-in (e.g./password-reset/or/admin/). These paths can be blocked in your Account Settings under Content.",
    "Which NLP service should I be using?": "Lytics usesGoogle NLPwhich pulls from their knowledge graph/taxonomy. If you determine you're not getting enough topics from your content, Lytics can useDiffbotin addition to Google NLP, which has more loose associations between topics and content. You'll bring in more topics, but may be slightly surprised by what you see! If your brand is international, you may need to consider which languages are supported by each NLP service. Please consult the provider documentation for a list of languages supported byGoogle NLPandDiffbot. Another option is to turn NLP completely off and use only custom topics. For more details on each service Lytics uses, seeNLP services.",
    "Backlog": "If you aren\u2019t seeing the content you expected to, note it may take some time for Lytics to crawl all of your content. By default, monthly limits exist for scanning new content (seeContent Enrichment limitsbelow). If Lytics scans all new content without having reached the limit, Lytics will move on to older content until it is all scanned. Please allow time for this. Also, consider how far back should Lytics be scanning. For example, it is likely unnecessary to scan content from 2 years ago. If people are no longer interacting with that content, use Account Settings to set a date to start the scan from.",
    "Content Enrichment limits": "Lytics will scan and enrich up to 20,000 URLs per month by default. This limit is designed to act as a guard rail to ensure good filter hygiene is in place. Most accounts do not publish close to 20,000 pieces of distinct content per month. If you believe your account is hitting this limit, please check with your Lytics Implementation team. Once confirmed, you can consider the following options: Are there any domains or content paths that you can block? This will likely be part of the solution. SeeAre there any paths that should be avoided?above for more information.Do you need Lytics to increase the limit?",
    "Robot directives": "Your domain likely has a robot directive (e.g.domain.com/robots.txt) that provides instructions to crawlers on how to crawl or index your content. Lytics will follow these directives. While typically not an issue, it\u2019s worth turning to your directives when troubleshooting any missing content or information.",
    "Metadata": "You may want to build a collection of content based on publish date or author. Consider the following if this is the case: If you have metadata on your website, is it usingOpenGraph? Open Graph tags will populate the following default values in Lytics:title,image,published_time,description, andlytics:topics. You can check thelytics_contentqueryin your account to check if all the Open Graph tags you need are being picked up. If you are not using Open Graph, Lytics may not be picking up any meta tags automatically. The quickest way to check that Lytics is bringing is to use our find a document tool to view the data Lytics has for a specific piece of content. Navigate toContent>Find a Documentand search for the URL of the piece of content you would like to view. If you make changes to your content's metadata and would like to preview those changes you can use our manual classification tool located at the bottom of theContent>Classificationdashboard. Enter the URL with the updated metadata and clickGet Details. Lytics will scan the document and display a preview of the updated metadata. If you are satisfied with the changes clickComplete Classification. If not, you can make additional edits and preview again. Alternatively, you can check by navigating toContent > Collections. Try to build content collections by author or publish date as these are the most commonly used filters. If the content doesn\u2019t come up as expected, you may need to curate your tags.",
    "Custom topics": "For many users outside of publishing who may not have rich content, NLP derived topics aren\u2019t enough. To accommodate this, Lytics can add custom topics via the metadata. The easiest way to do this is by adding thelytics:topicsmeta tag. Read more on providing custom topics. If you already have topics in your metadata using a different meta tag than the above, it\u2019s possible Lytics may be able to bring those in as well by making a change to your account settings. Speak with your implementation team about this. Once this setting is changed and content is rescanned, you will be able to build content collections with this topic, and users' affinities will be generated for these new topics.",
    "Total number of topics": "In the Lytics UI, you will see a max of 500 topics. Lytics keeps all of your topics, but only the top 500 are surfaced in the UI. As you block topics, Lytics will backfill to show 500.You can allow specific topics to ensure that they make the top 500. If you choose to allow topics, make sure that the topics actually exist - either as custom topics or are being generated by NLP. Case sensitivity is important when adding topics to the allow list. For example, allowingABBAis different than allowingAbba.",
    "Other content": "If you have other content on your site outside of web pages or images (e.g. PDFs) that you\u2019d like to derive topics from and have them generate affinities, Lytics will need to develop a plan to bring those in using our APIs.",
    "Document properties": "All topics - NLP derived or custom topics - will allow for two things: Building a content collection with the topics.Assign affinities to users for those topics. There are instances where you may want to build collections based on a topic, but not have them generate affinities. For example, a collection of featured sale items, SKUs, genres, etc. You can set these asdocument propertiesin your metadata to allow for this.",
    "Inline Content Recommendations": "Learn how to add seamless content recommendations to your website fueled by Lytics' Content Affinity Engine; all it takes is an API request and a little HTML. Difficulty:Beginner TLDR:Here's some docs instead. Other resources: A blog post - covering basically the same thing - with a live example!Lytics Segment API Docs(for segment creation API and SegmentQL)",
    "1. Build a Content Collection": "Before we go crazy adding recommendations to your website we should think about what kind of content we want to allow for recommendation. Lets create a dynamic set of content that will be the target pool of documents for this content recommendation block. To do this, we can use theLytics Segment APIcreate endpoint. In the command above, we made a POST request to create a new segment on the content table, or as we call it - a content collection. We usedSegment QLto define the filter on the content in your account. In the example above, we're only accepting urls that contain the pathfroyo/flavors. Simple enough, right? If you've used theAudience builderyou may notice that the logic for building a segment is essentially the same format. Here's a more complex example: You're probably wondering where these field names are coming from! These are the standard fields used in our content table. Here's a list of relevant fields you might use in building a content collection: Also if you have access to your queries in the Data tab of the Lytics UI you can see how the raw data from thelytics_content_enrichstream is parsed.",
    "2. Set up an inline recommendation": "To add inline content recommendations to your website all we have to do is draft some simple HTML. Pathfora will look for appropriately named data attributes, and replace the contents of these elements with recommendations from our APIs. First lets look at a simple, quick example, then we'll break down what these attributes mean: Here's a quick rundown of the relevant data attributes: imagedata-pftype attributes will set thesrcvalue if applied to animgelement (as with the example above) or if used on adivor some other type of element it will set thebackground-imageto be the primary image from the document. Similarly, theurldata-pftype attribute will set thehrefvalue to the url of the document if applied to anatag, but otheriwse will set the innerHTML of the element.",
    "Multiple Recommendations": "You may have seen a section on blogs  \"If you liked this, you may also like...\" with a list of three or more related articles. This is a common use case for content recommendations. We repeat the same HTML pattern to create multiple recommendations in a set, just remember to change thedata-pfblockvalue. If we have multiple recommendations using the same content collection then we will ensure that the same piece of content is not shown twice on one page. Here's a more in depth example, with a little CSS this can be easily styled to match your website:",
    "Step 1: Create a renewals audience": "Consider the fields available for renewal in your audiences.  Some common ones might include the time of last purchase, subscription start date, and subscription end date.  You might add additional criteria such as filters excluding complementary subscriptions. Consider that you will likely have several renewals audiences - one per subscription.",
    "Step 2: Export audience to all key integrations": "The focus of renewals and winbacks will be cross-channel which can include:Google,Facebook,Verizon Media (Yahoo Gemini), your email service provider (ESP) available asIntegrations, and the LyticsJourney Canvas(not an export).",
    "Step 3: Create on-site modals targeting renewals": "The most common renewal tactic is to deliver on-site modals to users with an upcoming renewal.  Take the renewal audience you created in step one, and then add custom personalized Experiences to target them.  See the slide-out modal on the left side below as an example.  Further instructions are available forbusiness usersand fordevelopers.",
    "Step 4: Add targeted email to your renewal journeys": "The email inbox is one of the most impactful places to reach your renewal users.  First, build an email in your ESP that can be triggered based on a Lytics audience.  You\u2019ll need to follow the instructions in your ESP to do so, and this varies considerably by tool. Once you have a triggered email built in your ESP, make use of the triggered email feature your ESP likely has. Whatever ESP you have, you probably do not want to include \u201cExisting Users\u201d in the audience, so we recommend leaving that box unchecked.  Once this export is configured, new customers who enter your renewal audience will be sent the automated message.

    "Step 5: Involve telesales (optional)": "Imagine incorporating your message across channels to even include telesales.  Your telesales team likely has a stronger closing rate on renewals than your site or your email programs ever could.  There are two ways to incorporate telesales: Encourage visitors to call inbound.Deliver a list of leads for targeted outbound.

Then, users on a mobile phone will be able to immediately talk to a rep on the phone:  Deliver a List of Leads for Targeted Outbound Build a list of all the upcoming renewals you care about.  Here\u2019s an example using several audiences of subscriptions expiring within the next 30 days as building blocks for a master telesales list: ",
    "Step 6: Incorporate direct mail (optional)": "Using the same example as above, consider adding address information to the export and sending it to a fulfillment provider who can send direct mail to your renewals.  As a final note, keep in mind there are many other areas to cover including copy choices, step-by-step optimization, and common pitfalls to avoid. These are beyond the scope of this playbook, but should be taken into consideration while developing your marketing strategy to retain customers.",
    "What are Authorizations?": "Channel tool authorizations refer to the permissions granted to various integrations that allow our platform to access and use data from third-party channels. These integrations can include email service providers, social media platforms, and advertising networks. Once permission has been granted, Lytics surfaces \"Authorizations,\" which allow you to manage and maintain the connection to your channel tools over time. This document outlines how to create and manage auths to ensure the long-term health of your data pipeline.",
    "Creating Authorizations": "Authorizations are currently accessed from your account navigation menu by selectingAccount > Security > Authorizations. Within the Authorizations section of the interface, you will see a list of existing Authorizations and a button to \"+ Create New,\" clicking this button will take you to the Authorization wizard, where you will: Choose the provider.Select the desired authorization method.Add a name (label), description, and complete the configuration options. You will need authorization for most jobs when going through the job creation wizard in Lytics. At the \"Choose Authorization\" step, you can opt to create a new authorization which will direct you to the authorizations wizard in a new tab. You will be prompted to choose the method and configure the authorization before configuring your job.",
    "Authorization Methods": "Note that some integration providers only have one authorization method, but others offer multiple methods such as API keys, OAuth, etc. Specific methods may enable different jobs, such as real-time vs. bulk audience exports. If you are unsure which method to use, you can find more information in your provider's integration documentation. For example, if you are looking to import event data from Google Cloud Pub/Sub into Lytics, there is only one method from the list of Google Cloud authorization methods that supports theImport Data (Cloud Pub/Sub)job in Lytics.",
    "Managing Authorizations": "The Authorization Summary provides essential details about each authorization to help ensure an integration is appropriately set up to enable data to flow in and out of Lytics. At the top of the summary page, you\u2019ll see the following information: Provider: The third-party tool that this authorization connects to.Method: Indicates how the authorization was made, such as API keys, OAuth, personal or business users, etc.Health: Indicates whether the Authorization is valid and active.Owner: Lytics user who created the authorization.Created At: The date the authorization was initially created.Last Updated: The date the authorization was most recently edited.",
    "What determines authorization health?": "Lytics checks the status of authorizations daily to help you proactively resolve authorization issues. Our API will return one of three possible statuses, depending on the data available for your provider: Healthy: The authorization is valid and active.Unhealthy: The authorization is invalid and inactive.Unknown: The authorization status is unknown. If your authorization is marked \"Unhealthy,\" Lytics cannot verify that it has the requisite access and permissions. Visit the Authorization page for your provider and confirm that the authorization credentials you entered have the necessary permissions in the external tool. If adjusting permissions in the external tool does not apply or is not an option, you may need to create a new authorization to use with your jobs in Lytics. You can optionally delete the unhealthy authorization.",
    "Edit or Delete Authorizations": "You can edit or delete authorizations directly in the Lytics UI using the buttons at the top right of each authorization summary page. The edit option allows you to rename the authorization and revise the description, but the configuration options cannot be changed. If you need a different configuration, you must create a new Authorization, and you can delete the previous one.",
    "Activity Metrics": "Once metrics are available for each authorization, this chart will become populated with the number of requests made using the authorization. You can adjust the date window and toggle to view the metrics hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the available data.",
    "Associated Jobs": "This table provides a helpful organization of all active jobs using the current authorization. Jobs can be sorted by name, type, status, and creation date. Click on a job to view more details on the job summary page.",
    "Authorizations Dashboard": "Authorizing the connection between Lytics and other providers allows you to create jobs to import, export, and enrich your first-party data. Navigate toAccount > Security > Authorizationsto find your Authorizations Dashboard, which gives an overview of all authorizations in your account and their usage. All authorizations are displayed in a table and are sortable by the following fields: Label: The name of the authorization as defined by your input for the \"label\" field.Description: Optional text field to differentiate authorizations. This is particularly useful when you have multiple Authorizations for a given provider.Provider: The third-party tool that the authorization is connecting to Lytics.Status: Indicates whether the authorization is valid and active.Created By: Lytics user who created the authorization.Last Modified: Date the authorization was last edited.

    "Amazon DSP": "Amazon DSP takes a different approach than Google in helping you comply with DMA requirements. When setting up export of cookies or emails to Amazon DSP, you will be asked to select all the countries where the user info was collected in theCountry Codesinput. Amazon DSP uses the source countries of your audience to prevent DMA requirements from being applied to out-of-scope countries such as UK, IN, US, JP etc. Amazon will treat any audience without a country code as in-scope for DMA. Please note that if no country codes are selected, your export is likely to report a 0% match rate.

    "IDP-initiated SSO (Legacy)": "Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by usingAuth0as a service provider usingSAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly. Behind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.",
    "Step 1. Install the Lytics JavaScript Tag": "In most cases, installing the Lytics JavaScript Tag version 3 is as easy as copying and pasting a few lines of code to your source code or Tag Manager. Full instructions and the tag itself are available from the web app.",
    "Verifying Your Installation": "The simplest method is using the Lytics web app verification checker. Visit your tag installation instructions, and you will find an installation checker in the top right. Be sure to visit your site after installing the tag, as this checker requires data to be fully collected and may take a few minutes to verify. A basic check can be done using your preferred browser's JavaScript developer console. Consult your browser's documentation for access. Once you have enabled the JavaScript console, use the following command to return the installed tag version. If a version number is successfully returned, the Lytics tag has been installed correctly and has begun collecting visitor data. ",
    "Step 2. Tracking Activity": "With an instance ofjstaginitialized, you can easily begin collecting data about your users by firing ajstag.send()call to the SDK as demonstrated below.",
    "Additional details": "url: The generated URL should never be changed as it will prevent your data from being sent to Lytics.cid: When using the tag generated from your Lytics account, your ID will be included and should not be altered.loadid: By default, Lytics will store a first and third-party cookie representing a user. Theloadidflag allows Lytics to use the third-party cookie if available, thus pulling cross-domain behavior into a single, unified user profile.stream: When collecting data across various domains, it is common to use a custom stream for each domain, which will require proper LQL in place to surface the collected data as user fields. Consult customer support for more details.serializer: This is set todefaultby default. During migration from v2 to v3 you may opt to use the legacy serializer which serializes data passed to Lytics in the same way as version 2 of the tag. It will ignore the \"grandparent\" namespace on deeply nested variable names. You should only opt to use thelegacyserializer if the data you're passing is deeply nested and you previously used v2 of the Lytics JavaScript tag.",
    "What data is collected?": "The followingraw fieldsare included along with any collect event managed by the Lytics JavaScript Tag.",
    "Page Views": "By default, an initial page view will be captured each time the browser fully loads a new URL. This ensures that you are collecting the base behavior out-of-the-box. Alternatively, you can capture a page view manually at any point during a session by calling thepageViewmethod.",
    "Advanced Options": "In addition to a JavaScript object payload, all Lytics JavaScript Tag collection methods accept three optional parameters. These should only be implemented by advanced users who fully understand the implications of using custom streams within Lytics or require feedback on asynchronous actions.",
    "Accessing Visitor Profiles": "In addition to collecting behavioral data related to a user's visit, the Lytics JavaScript Tag can also be configured to deliver real-time profile information back to the browser. By default, Lytics only returns the current audiences the visitor is a member of. However, by surfacing user fields, additional data from the visitor\u2019s profile can be returned. Listed below are the core methods available for understanding your website visitors.",
    "Lytics Anonymous ID": "Each time the Lytics JavaScript Tag is loaded, it will attempt to identify the visitor. This is done through a variety of means, the first of which is the first party_uidcookie. A unique identifier is generated and stored in the browser. This_uidis then included as part of the outbound payload in all collect methods from the JavaScript Tag aiding in identity resolution. In some cases, a developer must access or manipulate this ID. In those cases, there are two methods available. Manipulating the_uidis an advanced feature and can significantly impact how your profiles are compiled. Use at your own risk. Because getting the unique identifier can be an asynchronous process, you must pass a callback function with the request. Upon completing the lookup, this callback function will be called and passed an attribute that represents the visitor\u2019s unique identifier.",
    "User Attributes & Audience Membership": "Because loading of the current user's profile is done in real-time, a request to our profile API is required. This request is handled asynchronously as to never negatively impact your web properties. As such, it is recommended that access to this profile is always handled through our callback. This ensures you receive the expected result and do not run the risk of race conditions or other browser issues related to asynchronous requests. For use cases that can't support an asynchronous call, please see audiences cached in local storage below for an alternative option. To initialize a callback simply add a listener on theentityReadyfunction: Once the profile has been loaded, your callback function will be called and passed adataobject. By default, this data object will only contain the audiences the visitor is a member of and have also been enabled for API access. In addition to audience membership, any surfaced user fields will also be available on the object. In the example above the three audiences in thesegmentsarray have been enabled for API access and theemailuser field has been explicitly surfaced for the account. By default, Version 3 of the Lytics JS Tag caches the visitor's audience membership in local storage instead of a cookie. A forthcoming integration has been planned to support writing a cookie as well to facilitate some edge use cases but in the case of zero latency needs, local storage represents a better, more scalable storage solution for this type of data. In order to access the cached values on page load before the Lytics JavaScript tag has loaded the profile, you might implement something like:",
    "Custom User Identifier": "In some cases it is desired to use an identifier different than the Lytics cookie, for exampleuseridfor a logged in user. This configuration option is available by definingbyFieldKeyandbyFieldValueon theentitykey of the core Lytics JavaScript Tag configuration.",
    "Single Page Apps": "Some web properties will be built as Single Page Apps (SPA). SPAs shouldalwaysbe configured and managed by an experienced developer. They represent a series of unique behaviors, many unique to particular frameworks, that can impact how the Lytics JavaScript Tag needs to be configured to support the desired use cases. Version 3 of the Lytics JavaScript Tag has been built with SPAs in mind, along with other significant improvements. For most SPAs, there are two important things to consider as routes change: What represents the view of a newpage.When should the visitor\u2019s profile be reloaded or web-based integrations such as Facebook be updated. Each of these actions are handled independently with two simple commands.",
    "Hosting the Lytics JavaScript Tag": "While it's possible to download and examine the core Lytics JavaScript Tag (JS Tag) source files (latest.js,latest.min.jsorlio.js), storing or serving these file(s) locally or from another domain is not recommended. Referencing the Lytics JS Tag files from Lytics' servers (i.e.,<https://c.lytics.io/api/tag/someid/latest.js>) ensures that you get access to new features and product updates as they become available, giving you the most reliable collection and delivery of your data. That said, in some extreme cases it may be a requirement to serve all JavaScript files from your own secure environment. In these cases, we've created this document to outline the benefits, drawbacks, and a suggested approach.",
    "What are the benefits?": "Compliance with rigid security requirements.",
    "What are the drawbacks?": "Voids previously agreed upon Service-level agreements (SLAs) and support agreements due to the introduction of new and non-Lytics controlled infrastructure.Feature enhancements and bug fixes are made frequently to the Lytics JS Tag. Those that host their tag outside of Lytics will need to manually update the source to benefit from said improvements.Leveraging client-side integrations will require manual configuration while having limited support from the Lytics team.Additional Services hours or agreement to assist with initial installation and setup issues.Many account settings will no longer function as designed since configurations are not able to be updated dynamically.The core Lytics JS Tag endpoint has various levels of caching and protections to ensure it is always served no matter load or conditions. By hosting outside of the Lytics architecture, all caching and scalability concerns must be managed by the customer. Given these benefits and drawbacks, if your organization still wants to proceed with hosting the Lytics JS Tag, see the following steps to get started.",
    "Where should I start?": "Before you begin, ensure you are installing version 3 of the Lytics JS Tag. Version 2 can't be hosted outside of Lytics, which means you will be restricted to version 3 of the tag. Getting up and running with a hosted version of the Lytics JS Tag comes down to three main steps: Accessing the source code and default configuration.Navigating to the source code is relatively simple. The URL can be found by visiting the Tag Installation section of the Lytics app. The tag sample on that page will include ajstag.initfunction. One line below that you will see asrcdefinition and a URL that looks something like//c.lytics.io/api/tag/.... Copying and pasting that URL into a new browser window will result in the core JavaScript tag to be loaded. Most browsers will allow you to File -> Save the source from this point to your local machine.Hosting the source code and default configuration.The output file that was created above will need to be hosted on a public server within your infrastructure. Unfortunately, there is little to no guidance Lytics can offer here other than to be sure the hosting solution can handle the necessary load generated by your web asset(s).Initializing the tag.Return to the Tag Installation section and copy and paste the entire script tag as you normally would. ThesrcURL in theinitconfig will need to be updated with the URL of your now hosted JavaScript tag. You'll likely end up with something like this: Once your tag has been hosted and initialized properly, we recommend you complete the verification steps to ensure everything has been installed and is working properly.",
    "Subresource Integrity": "This document has moved.",
    "Working with Tag Managers": "Tag Managers make it easier to work with vendor JavaScript (JS) tags like Lytics for large, dynamic web assets. Lytics can be integrated through virtually every Tag Manager on the market today. Because each Tag Manager is different, the level of integration and development lift can vary so please consult the documentation for your preferred Tag Manager for specific details. That being said, installation of the Lytics JS Tag is generally as simple as copying and pasting the snippet of code from theinstallation instructionsin the Lytics app to a container within your Tag Manager, and then publishing to your live instance from there.",
    "Installing using Google Tag Manager": "Google Tag Manager(GTM) is recommended as a flexible and transparent Tag Manager. Follow the steps below to install the Lytics JS Tag using GTM. Log into yourGTMaccount.ClickNew Tagand thenTag Configuration.Under the Custom header, selectCustom HTML.Copy theLytics JS Tag snippetand paste it here.Name itLytics JavaScript Tag.In the Triggering section, selectAll Pages.ClickSave.Publish the container by clickingSubmit.Navigate to your website and click on several pages to trigger sample event. Wait a few minutes for the traffic to be received.Check theTag Installation Statusat the top right of theinstallation page.If you are not seeing traffic received, try repeating steps 9-10 before trying the basic troubleshooting steps.",
    "Is the tag loaded?": "The core JavaScript tag has a helper method that will returntrueif all Lytics resources have been loaded properly. Open theconsole in Chrome Developer toolsthen copy and paste the following to verify that the tag has finished loaded.",
    "Is data being sent to Lytics? What data? Why?": "The Lytics Jstag sends data to Lytics after every page view or on a custom trigger configured by the client. Those \"sends\" are captured in the network tab in developer tools. When the data is sent, how it is sent, and if it was sent successfully are all stored within the network call metadata. To start select the network tab and filter on\"lytics.io\". Once the list is populated, select a line that us structured like the one highlighted below:  The request URL can be found at the top of the \"Header\" section. This url indicates that data is being sent to Lytics via the /c endpoint.  The actual attributes that were sent to Lytics can be seen in the \"Payload\" section as seen below:  Testing To test the sending method there is also the jstag.send() function from the console and that will send a single payload to the account configured as the cid in the initialization of the tag. Please see the example below for syntax:  The network call should then show an event sending to Lytics:  _Finally, validate the event made it to Lytics by verifying the event has come in the UI via the stream/pipeline:",
    "Is my visitor's profile being retrieved correctly?": "The Lytics Jstag will use the/personalizeendpoint to retrieve the entity on every pageview. This ensures that the most relevant information is considered when deciding what the consumer experience should be while they are navigating the webpage. To start select the network tab and filter on\"lytics.io\". Once the list is populated select a line that us structured like the one highlighted below:  The request URL can be found at the top of the \"Header\" section. This url indicates that data is being retrieved from Lytics via the /personalize endpoint.  Additionally the preview tab, as seen below, can be very useful in understanding what information has been pulled in to update the consumers profile client side. ",
    "What sort of data is being stored client side? How is this controlled?": "Several types of consumer data are stored client side: Consumer AttributesConsumer behavior Consumer attributeswill be actual data from the profile like first_name, last_name etc... This information is stored on the entity itself and can be accessed for personalization. The Lytics user has full control over what attributes appear client side. _In this example _uids has been allow listed in the account settings to surface client side. _Account Setting:  Console in Dev Tools:  Consumer behaviorsexpose the different audiences a consumer is currently in and current experiences/campaigns they qualify for. Both of these behaviors can be found in the payload returned when calling jstag.getEntity in the console as seen below: Experiences  Audiences ",
    "How can I verify that the correct audiences are being returned?": "You can see the audiences the current user is a member of using the following in yourChrome developer console: This callback will return a list of audiences the user is a member of and should only be called after the user profile has loaded.",
    "Why aren't my numbers lining up?": "If you're troubleshooting numbers such as user counts within Lytics,check out this FAQon why your numbers may differ and our acceptable margin of error described below.",
    "Acceptable Margins of Error": "It is common to perform quality checks against audiences in Lytics vs. your other sources of truth. In a successful implementation, Lytics can reconcile users across channels and merge profiles, which makes one-to-one comparisons tough. However, below are quality checks that can be performed to ensure that the numbers you are seeing in Lytics match up as expected with other common data sources: Web Active Countsagainst Web Analytics for defined periods (for the difference in filters). Be sure you are comparing the same:Time period/date rangeWeb PropertyTaking into account employee traffic/botsComparing only audiences with a web cookieNumber of Subscribersby List (for profile merging -- e.g., a user may have more than one email).Build various audiences in Lytics based on file sources and compare numbers to original data. Google Audience/Web Analytics often reports higher numbers than Lytics. One main reason is Google Analytics reports how much unique traffic made it to a page. Lytics reports how many user profiles visited a page across browsers and devices. For any additional validation, you can export raw events or audience membership to Google Big Query, Amazon S3, or another data warehouse to query against. Please contactLytics supportfor assistance understanding or troubleshooting these numbers.",
    "Accessing Data from Server Side": "By default, Lytics returns a user's profile and any surfaced fields to the browser. This, however, is not always sufficient when it comes to marketing use cases. An alternative approach is to do the lookup based on the user cookie, utilizing the server side language of your choice. First, read the browser's cookies to get the visitor's_uidin order to identify them, make a request to thePersonalizationto get the visitors current profile, and then surface the profile as a JavaScript object.",
    "Identifying the Visitor": "Identifying the user can be done in a variety of ways. By default, Lytics sets a cookieseeridthat is used to identify a user. This is then surfaced in a user profile as_uid. The_uidfield is what the Lytics JavaScript tag uses for web based identity resolution. That said, if users are logged in or identified by another known key this can be used in place ofseeridin the following examples. Since we already have a cookie, all we need to do is read those to get the user profile from the Lytics API.",
    "Get Visitor's Profile": "Once you have an identifier, make a GET request to our personalization API. In this example, the cookie value is used to build a call to the personalization API for three fields:last_make,last_model,last_color. If you are using a custom key value pair for identification, replace the$fieldnameparameter with the field name of your identifier in Lytics and$valuewith the value of that key.",
    "Surface User Data in the Browser": "Next, parse the response and either inject the variables directly into your template or surface the profile as a JavaScript object.",
    "Lytics Integration Options": "If you don\u2019t see your ads or marketing tool in our integrations list we offer the following options to connect with other platforms. With our Integration Options we enable flexibility across the various channels where your data exists and tools to build customized integrations. Lytics Integration Options include: WebhooksLytics File Service integrations for server-to-server file transferJavascript TagMobile SDKData Warehouse Integrations Read on for details on each option. If you have questions about any of these options or would like to further explore an integration with a specific platform reach out to your Lytics contact.",
    "Server-to-Server File Transfer": "Server-to-server file transfer is a very common mechanism for data sharing. Lytics File Service options enable Lytics to pull or push user data from an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) using a CSV (comma-separated values) or JSON file. If you have another platform that also enables integrations via SFTP, this integration path helps to automate the process of passing data between your system and Lytics.

    "JavaScript Configuration": "Begin with a configuration for aform widget. Without defining any field customizations, Pathfora will default to using legacy form elements. However, you will be usingcustom form elementsin this guide. This config will generate a simple slideout with a form containing some default fields.  Once you have an idea of what form elements you want to include in your widget, you may use theform builder drag and drop UIprovided in the Pathfora documentation to construct the form you wish to display. Each field can be marked as required and may have a label and name (used for as the primary key for tracking the field in Lytics and other external systems). Text fields may also include placeholder text, and for fields with multiple options you may define the display text and value of each option.  Once you clickSave, the builder will output theformElementsfield that you can simply copy and paste into your widget config. This UI is intended to help you save time when constructing configurations with custom forms. ",
    "Styling the Recommendation Modal": "In this example, we will make some small adjustments to soften the look of the content recommendations. You can download the styles for this example fromGitHub.  When writing your own custom styles, remember that different users will see a different pieces of content based on interests. Be careful when adjusting the size of things like the image in relation to the text. Images from different articles may be of a different size, and text descriptions may vary in length if not controlled by thedescriptionLimitsetting. Be sure to test your modal with multiple different content items. You can do this by adding theshufflesettingto your config, which will change the content every time you see the modal. You may also want to ensure that all content in your collection has similar image sizes if you do want to adjust its styles in the modal. ",

    "Further details on integrating with Adobe products": "Adobe Campaign Lytics can export file based data to Adobe Campaign via hourly/daily CSV file export to an SFTP location. Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access. There are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis. As part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs. Our Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.  This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer. You can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed. Similar to other Adobe products, Adobe Ad Cloud supports the consumption of user audiences via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager. Lytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.  With our Google partnership, Lytics has early access to Google\u2019s API-based integration for custom audiences within DV360. We can deliver audiences into Audience Manager via SFTP or Data Warehouse integration, similar to how the above integrations have been documented.",

    "Google Analytics 4 (GA4)": "GA4, which was first released into beta in 2019, has replaced Universal Analytics (UA) as the default version for Google Analytics installations. GA4 offers a great deal of flexibility and power over its predecessor. The following document outlines the preferred method for enriching GA4 with an individual's profile information, such as audience membership and Lytics user ID. There are a variety of robust use cases enabled by this integration, most notably the ability to filter GA4 dashboards by Lytics Audiences as well as distribute those audiences efficiently across the Google ecosystem from GA4 directly. Lastly, web properties are complicated by nature. The following recommended approach aims to focus on ease of installation while also preventing a limitation of the power of GA4. Please note that it is always recommended that you consult with your technical teams or partners before proceeding.",
    "Step 1: Creating Dimensions": "To attribute onsite events such as page views or purchases, you must first define newCustom User Scoped Dimensionsto store the set of audiences and/or User ID depending on preference. This can be done through our server-to-server integration, in which we'll create two properties:Lytics User ID (ly_user_id_dim)andLytics Audiences (ly_segments_dim). Alternatively, because we'll pass the data to Google via JavaScript, you can create whatever dimensions you want by followingGoogle's documentation. If taking the manual approach, just be sure to use theuserscope option during creation. For details on our server-to-server integration please view ourGoogle Analytics: Setup Custom Dimensionsinstructions.",
    "Step 2: Enabling Lytics Audiences": "Once the necessary dimensions exist within your preferred Google Analytics account, you'll need to ensure all audiences you would like to send to GA4 are flagged asAPI Enabledfrom the Audience edit area of Lytics. This feature ensures no data is ever shared or passed to another tool without your explicit instructions to do so.",
    "Step 3: Configuring GA4": "Finally, leveraging the profile listener feature of our JavaScript tag, we'll get details of the current visitor and pass those along to GA4 via your new dimensions. Since there are a nearly infinite number of ways sites can be configured and constructed, it is always best to consult your technical team on this step. Here we'll outline the most common approach assuming that GA4 tag installation default instructions were followed. A typical installation of GA4 is completed by installing a few lines of JavaScript on your site. Typically in the header or footer. This will also need to be modified to include the setting of your custom dimensions as well as optionally altering how the initial pageview event is fired. The following example shows ultimately how we'll be sending data to GA4. To pass the current user's audience information as well as optional user ID, you'll first need to retrieve the profile via our personalization API. Luckily the Lytics tag makes this simple using ourentityready listener. The Lytics tag will call the desired function once it has identified the user and accessed their profile. Using the information returned, we'll send the user properties as outlined above. We'll alter the default listener example to verify we did receive audience membership data and then pass that along to GA4 as ourlytics_segments_dimdimensions or whatever you named it during the manual creation process. In this case, we also log a warning to the console when a set of audience memberships are unavailable for debugging purposes. For demonstration purposes, a full HTML example of loading the GA4 tag, Lytics tag, and listener function might look like the following: At this point, you should successfully pass audience membership to GA4 for each user. Given the flexibility of GA4, there are a variety of configuration options. That said, there are a couple of common points that are worth considering. The load order of tags is essential. For this to work correctly, you'll want to load tags in this order:GA4Lytics TagLytics ListenerIt may be desired that the GA4 default pageView tag is delayed until the profile information has been set. This ensures all events are associated with the user but could impact the efficiency of tracking page views. This is only recommended for advanced users with a firm understanding of JavaScript. In this case, you would disable the default page view asdescribed hereand then fire it manually following the setting of the user properties in our example.It may be desired to send an event to GA4 noting when the properties are set. This can be done following the entityready function and the user properties being set. For more information on the various ways to configure events, consultGoogle's documentation.When testing your integration, Google supports adebugsetting in their tag configuration settings. These settings allow access to a debug view where you can see the events stream in real-time to confirm proper behavior.",
    "Step 4: Add GA4 Audience": "The final step of this integration is to followGoogle's recommended approachfor building an audience inside of GA4 using custom dimensions. When prompted which dimension to use, you'll want to select thely_segments_dimor whatever custom parameter you created and then match based on the value of your audience or a regex match. When passing the audiences to GA4, Lytics converts them to astringseparated by commas as Google does not accept arrays. As such, the dimension value will look similar toaudience1,audience2,audience3.",

    "Triggered Push": "Trigger push notifications through Localytics when users enter a Lytics audience.",
    "\ud83d\udcd8TikTok Custom Audience requirements": "It might take a few hours for the audience matching to be completed in TikTok. After the initial file upload in a TikTok custom audience, a new file will not be appended until the custom audience is available to do so. The resulting TikTok custom audience must have a minimum of 1,000 matched and opted-in users in order to be available for use. If this minimum has not been met the custom audience will be marked asUnavailablewithin TikTok. We recommend sending at least 5,000 phone numbers or 10,000 emails, as phone numbers tend to have a higher match rate in TikTok. This suggestions is based on TikTok's requirement for 1000 matched trackable users within their platform.",
    "Topic Taxonomy": "Using data science techniques to look at the topic overlap between classified content, Lytics will programmatically build a topic taxonomy. In addition to programmatically building this taxonomy, Lytics dynamically adjusts the taxonomy as new content gets published. The topic taxonomy is stored as a weighted and directional graph. Although this structure may be daunting to look at\u2014and even more daunting to try and utilize by hand\u2014Lytics uses it when determining content recommendations. ",
    "Topic Relationships": "Topics are determined to be related by evaluating how they occur together and how they occur independently. When two topics occur together frequently (meaning in multiple documents), it is safe to assume they are related. In addition to the relationship existing, Lytics will determine thedirectionof the relationship. Is \"Cookies\" a subtopic of \"Baking\" or is \"Baking\" a subtopic of \"Cookies\"? The co-occurrence of topics determines the relationship. The independent occurrence of a topic determines the direction. Since the topic \"Cookies\" frequently occurs with \"Baking,\" but \"Baking\" frequently occurs without \"Cookies,\" \"Cookies\" must be a subtopic of \"Cookies.\" To draw this example further, \"Baking\" may be a subtopic of \"Recipes,\" \"Recipes\" may be a subtopic of \"Cooking,\" and \"Cooking\" may be a subtopic of \"Hobbies.\" This is important because it allows Lytics to make affinity inferences. A user with a high affinity for \"Cookies\" may be interested in general \"Baking\" content.",
    "Weighting Relationships": "The weight between relationships is incredibly important to consider when making affinity inferences. For instance, Michael Jordan played baseball professionally for one dark year in the 90s. This means there are valid relationships between Michael Jordan and Baseball and Michael Jordan and Basketball. Most people who know anything about sports or pop culture know Michael Jordan as a basketball icon. The way this gets reflected in taxonomy is through relationship weights. The weight between Michael Jordan and Basketball is strong, while the weight between Michael Jordan and Baseball is weak. By having weights, affinity inferences can use those weights as thresholds for building further relationships or recommending content. A user who has shown interest in Michael Jordan is more likely to be interested in Basketball than they are to be interested in Baseball. Unless they are interested in Sports Icons From The 90s, they might be more interested in Ken Griffey Jr. A rich topic taxonomy will surface this nuanced information.",
    "The Graph Representation of the Taxonomy": "A graph is the ideal data structure for topic taxonomies and taxonomies in general. Since each topic can have many subtopics and be the subtopic of many things, the correct way to structure this data is with a graph. Leaders in data modeling use this approach. Notable examples are Facebook'sSocial Graphand Google'sKnowledge Graph.",
    "Get Started with Lytics Segments": "Lets take an in-depth look at Lytics segments. We'll cover how to define a segment with SegmentQL or SegmentAST, as well as the Segment API endpoints to create, read, update, delete, scan, and list the segments in your account. Note that throughout this guide we use the term segment and audience interchangably. Specifically, the term audience refers to a segment on the user table. In your Lytics account there is also a separate table and schema for content. A segment on this table is often called a content collection. DifficultyBeginner TLDR:Checkout the Segment API documentation. Other resources: Lytics Go Client- Lytics API library for the go programming language.QLBridge- a go SQL Runtime Engine.Lytics Segment Scan with SQL.",
    "1. Defining A Segment": "If you haven't yet, take a minute to check out theaudience builderin your account. This can be accessed from the Audience tab in the Lytics UI and then by selecting tocreate a new audience. The audience builder is a visual interface for what we will cover in the first section of this guide - defining a segment. A segment definition at its core is really just a conditional statement. If the data we have collected on a user meets the conditions of the segment than they are considered a member. We have two different syntaxes for these conditional segment definitions: SegmentQL, and SegmentAST.",
    "SegmentQL": "SegmentQL is simple Query Language using filter statements. Before we dive too deep into the syntax, lets look at a segment built in the segment builder UI side by side with its SegmentQL definition.  In this examplecm_statusrefers to the subscriber status in Campaign Monitor, an email provider. So a marketer might build this audience as a target for all users who are active across their email and web channels in the last 7 days. For us developers, this simple query language is probably quite intuitive! Our UI exists for marketers to build audiences, but you might find it quicker to write SegmentQL, and create a segment through the API. Just to cover all our bases lets take an in depth look at the anatomy of a filter statement: [identifier]= alphanumeric string (often the name of a data field, table, or segment).[literal]= a string, int, float, boolean, or timestamp literal value. [from]is optional if creating a filter on the user table. [alias]is optional if you do not wish to save the segment.",
    "Segment AST": "SegmentAST expressions look very similar to SegmentQL but instead of having its own filter syntax it is formatted in JSON. It's perhaps less readable for a human, but if you're writing a program which creates or updates segment definitions it might be easier to format the bodies of your requests using SegmentAST. Lets look at the same example from above in SegmentAST.  Definitely not as easy to look at as SegmentQL, but if you spend a second scanning the JSON that you'll see it's generally the same expressions. Here is a breakdown of the key components:",
    "2. Segment Validate API": "The segment validate endpoint accepts a plain text SegmentQL statement and ensures that the definition is valid. This can be especially useful when creating a segment. Before sending a request to build the segment via the API you might want to validate it first. Note that this endpoint does not validate field names in your account. It simply checks the syntax of the SegmentQL statement.",
    "Segment Create": "The segment create endpoint accepts plain text (containing SegmentQL) or a JSON body (SegmentQL or AST).",
    "Segment Read": "You must know the segment ID or slug name to fetch the segment via the read endpoint.",
    "Segment Update": "You must know the ID or the slug of the segment to update.",
    "Segment Delete": "You must know the ID or the slug of the segment to delete.",
    "4. Segment List API": "For many of the CRUD operations we just talked about you need to know the ID or slug name of the segment. It may help to have access to a list of all existing segments in your account to use as a reference. The list endpoint will return a list of all segments for your account including id, slug, and the QL and/or AST definition of the segment.",
    "5. Segment Scan API": "The scan endpoint provides a list of all entities in a segment. For audiences (segments on the user table) the entities returned are user profiles. The scan endpoint can accept a number of different query parameters, we won't cover all of them here, but as always you can check outour docsfor the full details on this API. You can use this endpoint to scan an existing, saved segment in which case you'll need the segment ID or slug. You can also scan an ad-hoc segment by passing SegmentQL to the endpoint. If the total number of entities in the segment exceeds the limit provided in the request (the default value is 20) then we will paginate the results. In the JSON body, there will be a token value with the keynext. To get the next page of results in the scan, make a subsequent request with the query paramstartequal to thenexttoken from the prior request. The API will continue to returnnexttokens in each response until you've fully scaned the segment.",
    "Creating Audiences": "Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests. Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require. Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users.",
    "Building Audiences: Existing Audiences": "TheExisting Audiencestab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior. Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list arenotreal-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data. You can use theFilter by Audience Typedrop-down to filter the list or use theSearchbox to quickly find an audience by name.  Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing. ",
    "Building Audiences: Content Affinity": "TheContent Affinitytab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. SinceAffinitiesare agroup of related Topics, this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products.  In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics. Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users withAny Affinityare selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of theAffinitybuttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column. As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign.",
    "Topic-Based Audiences": "Under theCustom Ruletab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows: Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience BuilderSelect the Topic of interest.Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic. Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this: Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting. Some users may find a field namedInferred Content Affinitywhen trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about ourcontent taxonomy process. Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity.",
    "Building Audiences: Custom Rules": "TheCustom Rulestab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on auser fieldto the audience being built or edited. Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation.  The user field list displays all the fields in your account. TheSourcedrop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. TheIncludesdrop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use theSearchinput to search for a user field by name. Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition: Choose a User FieldChoose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than)Choose a value There are variations to this general procedure based on thetypeof the user field and the operator chosen.",
    "\ud83d\udea7Audiences Field Value Limits": "Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field. When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert: An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values.An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists).Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc.",
    "User Field Types": "How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile.",
    "Out of the Box Custom Rules": "Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules.",
    "Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets": "All audience definitions are comprised of rules based onexisting audiences,content affinity,campaigns, andcustom rules. You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option toAdd New RuleorAdd New Rule Set. Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target.",
    "Working With Multiple Rules": " This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristicBehavior: Perusers. This will select all users with anintensity scoreof 20 or less but with afrequency scoreof 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clickingAdd New Rule.    This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity forTechnologycontent. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristicBehavior: Perusers. The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity forTechnologycontent. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meetbothof these conditions.   Clicking theAnd/Ortoggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users whoeitherhave the characteristicBehavior: Perusersor have low afffinity forTechnologycontent.",
    "Excluding Rules": "In addition to theAnd/Ortoggle, there is theIncluded/Excludedtoggle. This toggleinvertsa condition. This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristicBrowser / OS: Mobileor users who have used a mobile devices.  Clicking theInclude/Excludetoggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users whodo nothave the characteristicBrowser / OS: Mobile.  The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s).   This is especially apparent when using a rule such asCreated Timestamp Exists. Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users whodo notmeet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0.  ",
    "Working With Rule Sets": "When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either anANDor anORis not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using anANDor anOR.  This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristicEmail Capture Status: Known Email. The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity forMarketingORAdvertisingcontent. Combining these two rulesets with theANDoperator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising.",
    "Excluding Rule Sets": " Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking theInclude/Excludetoogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses.",

    "Naming Your Audiences": "For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They\u2019re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important. Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface.  Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion.",

    "Activity Graph": "After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals: HourlyDailyWeeklyMonthly Audience Size Trends Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool. For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched.

    "Error Handling": "Webooks jobs are set up with a basic retrying mechanism on top of thestandard job retryingfor Lytics jobs. When a webhook request encounters a non-200 status code, the request will be retried unless the HTTP status code is in the do not retry list explained below. The job will retry errored requests until the job encounters 10 failed requests. Once 10 failed requests are encountered, the job will return an error, and enter into the normal Lytics job retry schedule as describedhere. If the error persists, then the job will go into a failed state. The following http request status codes are not retried since retrying will most likely result in the same status: 400 - Bad Request404 - Not found413 - Request Entity Too Large When setting up a webhook job, more status codes can be added to the never retry list by entering status codes intoDo not retry for HTTP Statusconfiguration. Requests that encounter a status code that is not retried, will be marked as omitted with the cause logged in the job logs. These request willnotcause the job to error. If the server returns aRetry-Afterdirective in the header, the job will go into sleeping state for the duration or until the time specified. The job will not error in this case, and the request will be retried when the job runs next.",

    "Streamlined Data Integration Process": "Integrating custom data into Lytics is simplified into two straightforward steps: Schema Definition: Outline the schema to dictate how your new data source should update existing customer profiles.Data Stream Creation: Establish a new data stream tailored to your source to ensure seamless data flow.",
    "Features of Schema Copilot": "Schema Copilot leverages advanced generative artificial intelligence to comprehensively scrutinize your new data source. It offers intuitive suggestions for fields and mappings, enabling seamless integration of your new data source with the existing schema. This intelligent assistance ensures that your data aligns perfectly with the Lytics platform, enhancing your customer data integration's overall efficiency and accuracy.",
    "Import User and Survey Data": "Import your SurveyMonkey contacts and their survey responses to add this information to your cross-channel user profiles in Lytics.",
    "Collecting Identifiers": "There are three ways to collect identifiers from SurveyMonkey surveys in order of complexity: Use SurveyMonkey's built in contacts and mailing service and theemail invitationcollector.Addcustom variablesto your survey and use aweb linkcollector in SurveyMonkey.Add a question directly asking for an identifier.",
    "Method 1": "This is the easiest to setup. Just followSurveyMonkey's instructionsto send out your survey by email to a list of contacts. The recipient's email address will be included in their responses and will allow them to be merged with their Lytics profile when imported.",
    "Method 2": "This method takes a little more setup, but is much more flexible in delivery options. Your surveys will need to havecustom variablesadded to themand will need to have the user's information inserted into the web link collector's URL. Depending on your delivery method, specific instructions on how to insert identifiers into the web link collector's URL will vary. TheSurveyMonkey Importwill automatically use thelytics_emailandlytics_uidcustom variables as identifiers.lytics_uidshould be a Lyticsuid. You can export theuidto a tool that sends the survey link, or retrieve the uid from theLytics JavaScript tagto embed or link to the survey from a webpage.lytics_emailshould be the user's email address that is stored in Lytics. Additionalcustom variablescan be used, but will need to bemapped in LQLto be used in Lytics.",
    "Method 3": "This method is the most complicated to configure. It will require specific wording of questions on all surveys you want to track and custom LQL to implement. To implement this method you will need to create a question in your survey to collect an identifier. For example: Please enter your email:Please enter your username from our website: You will then need to createcustom LQLto recognize the responses to these questions as identifiers so the responses can be merged into the user's profile. Using the example questions above, the LQL would look something like: Only questions with the exact wording used in the LQL will be recognized as an identifier, this includes capitalization and punctuation at the end of the question. Using the example LQL above, the following questions would not be recognized as containing an identifier: please enter your email:Please enter your emailenter your username:Please enter your Username from our website: This is the only method that works with all SurveyMonkey collector types, but due to the added complexity, we recommend using one of the other methods if possible.",
    "Using Survey Data": "By default, all questions and answers are stored in a map field,question_answer, on the user profile. This can be difficult to use as the map keys will be a truncated version of the question text. We recommend creatingcustom LQL mappingsfor questions that are relevant to your marketing audiences. Questions and their answers are placed into thesurveymonkey_responsesstream in the fieldquestions_answers. They are stored as a map with the question text as the map key, and the answer as the value.Long questions will be truncated. Questions should be kept as short as possible. For example, if you wanted to create an audience around users that were planning to retire soon you might have a true/false survey question like:Are you planning to retire in the next year? This will appear in the Lytics stream as:questions_answers.Are you planning to retire in the next year? This can be difficult to use in an audience definition, so we suggest remapping it using LQL like: This would remap the response to the user fieldretire_next_yearfor use in Lytics audiences.",
    "User Profile Health": "Because Lytics user profiles are created by stitching data across sources the stability of a given profile depends on the quality and quantity of data used to create it. Lytics is now surfacing the \"health\" of user profiles to improve your account performance and reliability. Healthy profilesare stable and actionable, with strong identifiers connecting data fragments across sources to the right user.Unhealthy profilesare unstable and not actionable, as they are either missing entirely or missing a subset of data. Lytics is providing visibility into user profile health to facilitate the resolution of various issues caused by unhealthy profiles, which can include missing data, inconsistent audience counts between Lytics and other tools, and duplicate profiles in audience exports/triggers.",
    "Unhealthy Profiles": "A user profile is considered unhealthy if the traversal through all data fragments fails for any reason. Unhealthy profiles are mostly commonly hitting one of the following limitations: Max NeighborsMax TraversalsProfile size is too large Unhealthy profiles in Lytics are no longer processed for audience evaluations, audience exports or triggers, and enrichment processes, including behavioral scoring and content affinity calculations. Because unhealthy profiles are unusable in Lytics or any of your connected marketing tools, this change will reduce latencies and ensure that only valid user profiles are surfaced for activations.",
    "What information is contained for unhealthy profiles?": "Unhealthy profiles only contain unique identifiers (\u201cby fields\u201d) and meta fields such as profile size, an indication of why the profile is unhealthy, the data stream names, etc. _num_aliases_num_events_num_streams_num_days_num_conflicts_conflicts_num_max_neighbors_max_traversals_num_nested_values_total_sz_cust_sz_internal_sz_elasticsearch_size_streamnames_profile_processing_failure_broken_profile_broke_max_size_broken_profile_broke_max_fragment_size_broken_profile_max_neighbors_broken_profile_nested_count Lytics is not destroying or losing any data about your users. Rather, unhealthy profiles simply no longer surface the portion of a profile that can be retrieved as it may result in inaccurate audience counts and activations.",
    "How can I identify unhealthy profiles?": "A new, predefined audience called \"Unhealthy Profiles'' will be made available in all accounts. If user profiles become unhealthy, then we should see an increase in this audience at the same rate that we see a decrease in other audiences.",
    "Will other audiences be affected by this change?": "The only fields that we drop from the profiles when they become unhealthy are the non-\"by fields.\" So an audience that only has conditions on those \"by fields\" will not be affected. For example,Filter Exists emailwouldn't be affected, but the audienceFilter Exists emailANDState=WAwould be affected. The latter would be affected because Lytics will drop the state field for the unhealthy profiles.",
    "How can I resolve unhealthy profiles?": "Contact your Lytics Account Manager to discuss a strategy to resolve or reduce the number of unhealthy profiles. The approach will vary depending on your identity resolution strategy and the requirements of your marketing use cases.",
    "Can I export unhealthy profiles?": "Yes, the \"Unhealthy Profiles\" audience can be exported via BigQuery, SFTP or S3. However, unhealthy profiles cannot be exported to other provider tools for activations since they are excluded from the audience evaluation process.",
    "Profile Limits": "User profiles become unhealthy by hitting one or more of the following limits.",
    "Max Neighbors": "\u201cMax neighbors\u201d refers to the number of edges associated with a node. A node is created in Lytics' graph when an identifier is introduced to a user profile. Audience Impact: From an activation perspective, this means that what would have been one user profile in the audience is now increased to how many fragmented nodes there were. Above is an example of when max neighbors could impact a profile. The profile on the left has one email and many web cookies. Each time a user gets a new web cookie and they are logged into the site, Lytics will update the graph with a new node. Over time, the node with an email will have more and more cookies associated with it until it hits the max neighbors limit. Once the profile hits max traversals, the email node will drop off. Then, instead of having one user profile in the Lytics audience builder, there will be as many profiles as there are fragmented nodes off the original (four in this example).",
    "Max Traversals": "\u201cMax Traversals\u201d refers to the number of edges that need to be traversed in order to retrieve the user profile for the audience. Once this hits the limit specified on the account, the profile will no longer update. Audience Impact: If a user hits max traversals, their profile will no longer be updated for audience building and will fall into a \u201cstale state.\u201d See the following examples: If a user has opted out for emails and they hit max traversals, they will not be opted out even if the event is received to opt them out. They will be stuck in that audience unless the criteria changes and they no longer qualify.If a user has opted out for an email and they do not qualify for the audience originally but eventually opt in, that will not be reflected on the profile in the audience builder.",
    "Profile Size": "When a profile becomes too large, it cannot be pulled in for audience building at all. At this point the profile is unusable.  There are a few different points in our pipeline which can trigger a profile to be marked unhealthy due to size: If a single node in the graph becomes too large to write to the underlying data structure for our graph, we mark that node as unhealthy (subsequently marking any profile built from that node in the graph as unhealthy).  This particular size limit leads to data loss, as we could not write updated attribution to the node in the graph, and cannot guarantee profile accuracy.  This particular instance of size check can be resolved by addressing the root source contributing to the size of data attempting to be written (i.e. place a cap on the number of values retained in some set / map fields), and replaying the account.If the traversal of the graph builds a complete profile that is too large to write to the underlying data structure for our entity storage, we mark the profile as unhealthy. This can typically be resolved without requiring a replay, as there has been no potential data loss in the graph, and often involves addressing the root source contributing and simply re-evaluating the profile impacted (this re-evaluation can occur by receiving new events for that profile, or during our natural cadence of re-scoring profiles).If a full profile is not too large for our key indexed profile storage, but is too large to write to our fully indexed (used for bulk exports / ad-hoc audience scans) profile storage, this is treated equally to (2) and the profile is marked unhealthy with equal resolution strategy.",
    "Impact of Browser Tracking Changes": "Announcements about browsers changing their cookie tracking policies have created tremendous concern and confusion within marketing and advertising industries, and rightfully so. These changes represent dramatic shifts in how users and their activity are tracked across the web. Browsers are removing third-party cookies and altering the default behavior of first-party cookies, which makes first-party data mission-critical for marketers more than ever before. The following explains how current and upcoming browser changes will impact your web tracking involving Lytics.",
    "Overall impact": "The blocking of third-party cookies, whether by browser default or user choice, will significantly impact the effectiveness, if not viability, of ad targeting, retargeting, attribution, and measurement efforts dependent on the use of third-party cookies. In addition, Apple\u2019s ITP 2.2 impacts certain marketing use cases. For Safari users, cookies get cleared after seven days if there is no activity. So if a user visits a site once and returns eight days later, their cookie will be gone. However, if that user returns every day for eight days, their cookie will remain intact. This can skew analytics, impact personalization efforts for anonymous users, and affect conversion attribution. But put it in perspective, while Safari accounts for over half of mobile web traffic in the US for non-mobile and worldwide browser usage, Safari\u2019s market share is around 20 percent as of January 2020. More importantly, these browser changes continue the trend of giving individuals more control over what brands/entities they want to engage with and transparency in that regard. They point to the need for brands to maximize relevant content or offerings for a site visitor in real-time, which can lead to registration or other means of establishing a known, first-party relationship. These browser changes reflect the change from a model that exploits third-party data outside an established relationship to transparently establishing and cultivating a relationship with the consumer for mutual benefit.",
    "Impact on Lytics": "The good news is Lytics was designed to help companies establish first-party relationships with their customers and implement intelligent identity resolution strategies. Lytics enables you to collect and leverage first-party data in various ways, such as: acquiring new customers, serving ads on-site with highly targeted audiences, and promoting relevant content to users based on their interests. Onto the technical details. To understand how these browser changes will impact the Lytics JavaScript tag (aka Tracking Tag) you must first understand the core mechanics of how Lytics builds profiles for your anonymous visitors. It all begins with Lytics\u2019 unique client-side identifier, which is referred to as the UID or_uid. When a user visits your web property for the first time, the Lytics tag generates a unique value for this UID and stores it as a browser cookie. This UID is then appended to any behavioral data collected from their visit. Typically when a user returns after a subsequent visit, this UID persists since it has been stored as a cookie. The impact of cookie changes on this process will vary by browser. In the case of Safari, for example, it means that if a user does not return within seven days, that particular identifier will be deleted. As such, it will become imperative to double down on your identity resolution strategies and ensure that efforts are being made to associate first-party anonymous cookies with other known identifiers that can persist, such as user IDs upon login. In addition, some customers leverage theloadidparameter as part of their tag configuration. Historically, this has enabled a simple method for resolving identities across web properties. Thisloadidmethod relies on third-party cookies, which are impacted heavily by these cookie changes. Like the first-party implications above, cross-domain identity resolution strategies become more important. To date, efforts have been made to rely less on browser cookies, given their uncertain nature. Version 3 of the Lytics JavaScript tag was built to be more secure and flexible**, allowing Lytics to respond to these types of changes more efficiently. At the end of the day, however, restricting or removing cookies, in general, will affect the way that you, the marketer, use and monitor the web. Focusing on safe, secure, and transparent resolution strategies is at the core of the Lytics platform, and we believe will allow any marketer to overcome these changes in the future. Q. What cookies are issued in connection with the Lytics tag? By default, Lytics sets a cookieseeridthat is used to identify a user. This is then surfaced in a users profile as_uid. Out of the box, this is what our JavaScript tag uses for web-based identity resolution. Q. Are Lytics\u2019 cookies first-party cookies or third-party cookies? When issued by the client website domain on which they run, Lytics\u2019 cookies are treated by browsers as first-party cookies. This is the case for all of our clients. In some cases, clients have established separate top-level domains for two or more of their brands. In these cases, many have leveraged an optional identity resolution aid that allows Lytics to store the same identifier as a third-party cookie. This allows for a hands-off approach to resolve identities across domains but in no way impacts the nature of our first-party cookies described above.",
    "Stale cookie removal feature": "Lytics has enabled a \u201ccookie culling\u201d feature that prevents \u201cstale\u201d (old) cookies from being used as identifiers to stitch the user profile fragments. Given the browser cookie limits mentioned above, this ensures only valid identifiers will be used to build your Lytics user profiles, which helps keep them clean and consolidated. For example, if a Safari user visits your site once and doesn\u2019t return within two months, Lytics can remove this cookie from their first visit as it has become \u201cstale.\u201d There is no reason to keep this cookie as an identifier because it can\u2019t be used for personalization. Lytics recommends opting for a maximum of 60 days to keep cookies, but this setting can be customized according to your needs. Don't hesitate to contact your Lytics Account Manager if you are interested in enabling this cookie-culling feature. Once Lytics removes cookies after your specified time frame, not only the \u201cstale\u201d cookies are removed, but any other profile fragments attached to those cookies will be omitted from the stitching process. As a result, any associated data with the old cookies will not be included on user profilesunlessthat data can be matched to some other identifier (e.g., an email or user ID). However, the data lost from turning on cookie culling can be found again if the feature is turned off or if the time range is shortened so that the cookie associated with the missing data is no longer skipped.",
    "Cookie changes per browser": "The following information has been updated as of January 31, 2020. Cookies are used for persistent login, preference storage, and tracking across websites. Google, Apple, and other browser providers have deployed functionality that can block the tracking of users across websites. This functionality is promoted as privacy-enhancing by giving a user greater control to prevent website tracking. The technology generally focuses on third-party cookies, but Apple\u2019s technology also focuses on certain first-party cookies.",
    "Apple": "Apple introduced its Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP) functionality in 2017 to block the use of cookies deployed on sites not belonging to the party issuing the cookie. You can track Safari ITP changes on Apple\u2019sWebKitwebsite. Generally, Safari has set a 7-day expiration period on first-party cookies but a shorter 1-day setting on certain cookies used with link decoration. This means for users that don\u2019t revisit a site within seven days to extend their expiration, the cookie will be deleted, and these users will get new identifiers the next time they visit the site.",
    "Firefox": "Like Safari, Firefox blocks third-party cookies by default throughEnhanced Tracking Protection.",
    "Google": "In 2019 Googleannouncedit was changing its approach to third-party cookies by not blocking them by default and recommending cookie developers useSameSite attributes. Chromegives users optionsto block the cookies they want to block and to delete cookies after a session (fingerprinting out as well). In mid-January of 2020,Google announcedits intent to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022.",

    "Deep Dive: Migrating from Queries to Conductor Schema": "TL;DR:Many things you liked about LQL are still here, and many things you didn't like are out.  Migrating your schema management to Lytics' Schema API within Conductor can simplify your workflows.",
    "Intro": "Lytics' profile pipeline processes your customer data in real-time to perform data cleansing, data transformation, data deduplication, and identity resolution. Historically, these functions were performed in an expressive SQL-like scripting language calledLQL.  After listening to how our customers used LQL and the operational scaffolding they developed to ensure reliability while enabling process scalability, we introduced a new Schema API. Conductor provides a UI-based flow for interacting with Schema AP. Longtime Lytics users who are comfortable with LQL have appreciated: Brevity: LQL combined both datadefinition(DDL) and datamanipulation(DML).Readability: LQL reads similarly to SQL, which makes sense to a lot of database practitioners. Longtime Lytics users who were uncomfortable with LQL didn't appreciate: DRY violations: A common development mantra statesDon't Repeat Yourself(DRY).  Repeating your code in multiple places introduces opportunities for inconsistency, and many LQL statements mapping data into the same field could yield inconsistent or unexpected results.Lack of versioning: When you post LQL, you're doing it live!  This can be problematic when there are large changesets that you want to stage together, or if you want to understand what changed at a given time.Learning curve: Not every update needs to be complicated, and requiring users to learn LQL to make even small changes became prohibitive for many of them. Lytics' newSchemaAPI allows you to use LQL expressions within a JSON framework with native version control.",
    "Analogs": "An LQL statement combines features of datadefinitionand datamanipulation.  In the Schema API, data definition is expressed through fields, and data manipulation is expressed through mappings. ",
    "How to Get Started": "Getting started is simple.  All of your queries have been automatically translated into appropriate fields and mapping objects. It is recommended to immediately publish your default schemabeforemaking any changes to it.  After it has been published, any changes can be published in batches to ensure better visibility on what changes go out. While you're not required to immediately start using Lytics' new Schema API, the classic Query API will be deprecated starting February 1, 2024",
    "Viewing Topics": "To viewTopicsin your account, click on theStandardInterest Engine and select theTopicstab. The table above displays the top 500Topicsassociated with theStandardInterest Engine. Each row indicates the number of documents tied to that Topic, as well as the number of users who have a Topic-score for it. For theStandardInterest Engine, Topics are generated using Lytics' Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, as well as meta-tags from webpages. To learn more about how Topics are enriched, visit ourEnrichmentdocumentation.",
    "Blocking Topics": "In some cases, Lytics' NLP tools may identify irrelevant Topics. To address this, you can block unwanted Topics by selecting the checkbox next to each one. Once blocked, the Topic will appear in the Blocked Topics table and will no longer show up on user profiles or in documents.",
    "Topic Summary": "When you click on aTopicin the Topics table, you\u2019ll be taken to the Topic Summary page, which provides detailed insights about the selected Topic.

These related Topics appear in the bottom-right corner of the page and are also visible in the Content Map view. TheTopic Taxonomy(or Content Map) is built by analyzing documents and the Topics they contain, revealing patterns of co-occurrence and Topic prevalence. You can use the slider at the bottom of the Content Map to highlight strong connections\u2014Topics that frequently appear together. In the example below, we can see that theFurnituretopic is highlighted, as well as each of its related Topics (such asHouse, andFaux Fur Bean Bag).",
    "Segmentation With Topics": "When you click the+ New Audiencebutton, you\u2019ll be redirected to the Audience Builder. The Topic score distribution chart can help you decide on an appropriate threshold when creating segments. To include all users who have shown any interest in a Topic, use theExistsoperator.",
    "Key Sections": "The Identity Explorer is organized into several key sections, each offering a unique perspective into the consumer:",
    "Identity": "In the \"Identity\" section, you can explore the relationships between unique identifiers that establish connections across the various channels the consumer engages with. The \"Identifier List\" provides a detailed overview of the keys and values used for linking, while the \"Identity Graph\" visually represents these relationships. This section helps you understand how the consumer is identified and linked across platforms.",
    "Profile Fields": "The \"Profile Fields\" section encompasses an exhaustive catalog (feature store) of attributes along with their corresponding values linked to the customer's profile. This encompasses default schema fields from connected tools, custom attributes, and many inferred or machine learning-based attributes generated by Lytics. This section offers an expansive overview of the consumer's data, facilitating precise targeting and personalized interactions.",
    "Searching & Filtering": "The \"Profile Fields\" view can be filtered by either typing in a query or selecting any combination of pre-built filters. We find it most effective to filter by the field categories to simplify the view during exploration.",
    "Raw Data": "For developers and data enthusiasts, the \"Raw Data\" section offers a JSON representation of the complete profile.",
    "Content Affinity": "The \"Content Affinity\" section provides a graphical representation of product and content-based affinity scores for the user. It reveals the user's preferences and interests, enabling you to make data-driven recommendations and content suggestions.",
    "Deleting Profiles": "In support of GDPR Profile Administrators may also delete a single profile or download the profile data to provide to a consumer directly if requested.",
    "Accessing Data from JavaScript Tag": "Once user fields have been surfaced, they can be used to personalize a user's experience. For example, a theoretical car buying site has surfaced some basic info about a user's last vehicle search results in the following data available in the browser.",
    "Populate a Form": "Create a JavaScript function that populates form fields. Initialize the callback handler. Create a callback: This will execute an action via JavaScript once the visitor has been identified and the profile has been loaded (using the function outlined above). Once the profile has loaded, Lytics will call the JavaScript function and populate the form on the site. Once all the above steps are completed, the final code is as follows: This is one basic example of leveraging the current visitor's profile information. The personalization powered by Lytics builds from here. Using a similar pattern, you could surface new listings on the site's index page that match a user's last search or present other vehicles that user may be interested in.",
    "Creating a New Custom Interest Engine": "To create a new Custom Interest Engine, click on theNew Interest Enginebutton on theInterest Enginespage. Once the modal opens up, clicking on theAffinity Customizationtile will open a wizard. The first step requires selecting the unique identifier and features (or Topics) from your inventory (ie thecontenttable). In the screenshot below, we are using the Shopify example from earlier, and using theshopify_product_idandshopify_product_tagsfields. Once the Inventory and Features have been identified, the next step requires mapping the data to your user profiles. The Inventory Field refers to the field on theusertable that contains a set ofshopify_product_ids(ie a set of unique identifiers from thecontenttable). In this case, theshopify_product_idsfield is an array of IDs that a user has purchased. Next, configure the name of the output field - this field will contain theshopify_product_tagsthat a user has expressed interest in based on theirshopify_product_ids.",

    "Contact Lytics to grant permission": "Lytics will need the role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from your AWS account to grant permission to. ContactLytics Supportwith the ARN. It will look like this example if you followed the instructions above.",
    "1. Targeting": "Though it may be obvious, considering who you're targeting with modals is extremely important and often overlooked. Put yourselves in the visitor's shoes. If, for example, you are visiting a site for the very first time, it is unlikely your experience will be positive if the vast majority of the site that you are visiting is covered with a giant offer modal as soon as the page loads. Example of full page takeover on the second click of a user's first visit before they had a chance to explore the brand. Example of half page takeover on user's first visit. Added for comedic value. First page view popup on article talking about discussion one of Google's many announcements to penalize such experiences. Because Lytics allows you to target users based onprofile details, audience membership and behavior in real-time, perhaps you take a more subtle approach for new customers while being a bit more bold with visitors showing strong signs of conversion or history with your brand. It is all too common on the web today to see companies take a \"spray and pray\" marketing approach where all visitors get blasted by intrusive data collection or offer modals at the beginning of their experience. This is seen as a negative for nearly all search and ad providers, many of which addressed this particular topic publicly. Google Blog Post Addressing Mobile Popups",
    "2. Modal Size & Position": "To build onTargeting, there may be cases where delivering a message at the beginning of a visit is important and actually improves the experience. Consider the size and position of where that message is delivered. Does it cover prime real estate requiring the user to alter their patterns in order to see the content they want? Does it leverage a small slide-out and offer a more efficient path to value while not restricting consumption? There is no silver bullet here but testing various applications to determine the right balance can yield great results.",
    "3. Device": "The device being used is often not considered when attempting to locate the root cause of a negative change. Keep in mind that modals and the site experience in general can be drastically different from device to device. A modal that is not intrusive on desktop may cover the entire canvas on mobile. Be sure to leverage your analytics tools to determine what devices are suffering from a drop off. Follow up by altering the targeting and presentation based on device or consider shutting web personalization modals off entirely in the case of mobile. Example of cookie acceptance modal on desktop - small and not disruptive. Example of cookie acceptance modal on mobile - much larger and more disruptive.",
    "4. Time on Site & Session Depth": "As we mentioned in our first example where the visitor received an offer immediately upon their first page view, one thing to consider and test is when a modal is shown. Lytics offers a variety ofdisplay optionswhich allow you to only show the modal after a set amount of seconds, after some amount of scrolling, etc. All of these levers can ensure a message is delivered after a visitor has made a connection and consumed enough content in order to make the modal experience positive.",
    "5. Inline Personalization": "The Lyticsweb personalization SDKis one method for delivering personalized communications on site. It was designed to offer a light lift and quick time to value but may not meet the needs of every use case. As such, theLytics JavaScript tagand variousPersonalizationAPIs can be leveraged in more custom applications to offer hyper targeting and personalized content in virtually any situation. At the end of the day, the user experience is everything and this should be a core focus of all marketing applications when looking to get the most out of ad and search related tools.",

    "Export Audience to List": "Export a Lytics audience to an iContact list to make use of your Lytics powered audiences in iContact.",
    "What is a \u201csync\u201d in the context of Cloud Connect?": "A sync refers to the process of running SQL queries configured on Data Models against data warehouses and then updating Lytics profiles with any changes that have occurred since the previous sync.",
    "Will my SQL query only be run once per sync?": "Most of the time, yes. However, if an interruption occurs during the sync (either due to a processing or network error), we\u2019ll attempt to resume the sync from the place where we left off. If that occurs, we\u2019ll need to rerun the query.",
    "Why are the sync times slightly different than what I\u2019d expect?": "On the Data Model Details page, we display two timestamps related to the sync for your Data Model: \u201cLast Sync on\u201d and \u201cNext Sync On\u201d. The \u201cLast Sync On\u201d timestamp displays the exact time when your Data Model was last synced. However, the timestamp shown for \u201cNext Sync On\u201d will vary slightly from the time when your model will actually sync. In an effort to reduce the number of syncs needed, we set the \u201cNext Sync On\u201d timestamp in a way where more models will end up synced together. Then every hour, we check to see which models are ready to sync - if \u201cNext Sync on\u201d is in the past, we sync the model. Ultimately, you should think of your selected sync frequency as the number of times per day your model will sync (e.g. a model with a sync frequency of four hours will sync six times per day). The \u201cNext Sync on\u201d timestamp gives an estimate as to when the next sync will occur rather than the exact time.",
    "Why can\u2019t I create a Data Model that returns no rows?": "We use the columns returned by the SQL query to set up our internal schema. If no data is returned by the query, we don\u2019t have the required information to correctly set up our schema. Note that once the schema is set up, your Data Model will continue to sync regardless of how many rows are returned.",
    "Why can\u2019t I create/update a Data Model when my schema has unpublished changes?": "Creating a Data Model modifies your Conductor schema - at a minimum, a true/false \u201cmembership\u201d field will be added to denote whether a profile falls into that Data Model. In addition, one field is added for each activated field that\u2019s selected. In order for these fields to be added, your Conductor schema cannot be in a draft state. When updating a Data Model, we\u2019ll attempt to update your Conductor schema if any activated fields are being changed. For this reason, if you try to edit your activated fields and your schema has unpublished changes, we\u2019ll reject the update.",
    "Can I select any field as the primary key?": "The UI allows for selecting any column that\u2019s returned by your SQL query as your primary key. However, it\u2019s important that the selected primary key field contain unique values. If there are duplicate values, we cannot guarantee that the values for your activated fields will be correct. You should choose a field whose values will match to the values of an existing \u201cby\u201d field in your Lytics schema.",
    "Can I select any field as the Lytics key?": "No; only \u201cby\u201d fields can be selected. Further, once a Data Model has been created for a certain primary key, all subsequent Data Models which use that primary key must also use that same Lytics key.",
    "Sync Failures Related To Collation": "Cloud Connect requires that the column you use as the primary key of your data model queries be UTF-8 collated. If your column is collated differently, this can cause your data model syncs to fail. Most database providers allow columns to be converted to a particular collation within a query. If your primary key column is collated differently, consult the documentation of your database provider to ensure a compatible collation: SnowflakeBigQueryAzureRedShift",
    "Stitching User Profiles": "This guide gives context on Lytics user profiles and helps illustrate the most common ways to combine orstitchprofiles based on shared identifiers. While it is geared for marketers, you will likely need a developer on your team to implement some of these tactics.",
    "Common identifiers": "A common identifier is used by Lytics to create a user profile, but it\u2019s one that also exists in another source. Some examples include: All of these users will merge into one profile in Lytics because they share identifiers. This will happen automatically as soon as these data points are imported. The import is themerge event.",
    "Merging events": "But how would you merge an anonymous profile that ONLY has a cookie ID with a profile that has a known identifier like email? This is one of the most common use cases for Lytics users, and one that will set you up for success. To do this, you\u2019ll need to identify or create potential merge events. Again, more details can be found in the Profiles and Identity Resolution document, but here we\u2019ll provide examples of common scenarios that you may consider when planning your strategy.",
    "Lytics Modal Experiences": "You can build Email Capture Modal Experiences directly in Lytics that prompt users to sign up for an e-newsletter, or receive a coupon, for example. As soon as a user fills in their email, Lytics will tie the anonymous cookie profile to the email they submitted. If their email was already in our system under a different profile, Lytics will merge the two profiles into one. For information on building email capture Experiences, see the Experience Editor documentation.",
    "On-site events: forms": "Any of your website forms where a user submits an email are great places to create a merge event of a Lytics cookie to email. By using thejstag.send()event or setting up a Google Tag Manager Trigger, Lytics can attach an email to an anonymous profile. Some types of commonly used forms include: User log-inAny sign-ups (events, newsletters)Registrations / warranties (products)Gated content (webinars, whitepapers) Note that you can submit other data using this method. For example, if users fill in their name, profession, address, etc. in the form, you can send this as well and Lytics will append it to their profile. Keep in mind this will only work for forms living on your website. For forms populated in an iframe or hosted in a different way, you may need to use the Lytics pixel or an API call to capture this information. See the documentSending Data to Lyticsfor more information on using the JavaScript tag and other methods.",
    "Email click-through identifier": "Many email service providers (ESPs) have a unique user ID within their system, separate from email. It's encouraged to pass this identifier, hashed email, or any other non-PII identifier as a query string parameter within links you include in any email communication. If you are familiar with UTM parameters, this is similar. Once you set this up in your ESP, Lytics can associate this additional identifier as another merge rule. So moving forward, whenever a user clicks on an email link that drives them to your website with the Lytics tag, Lytics will be able to stitch the email to a cookie. Examples: domain.com/news/article_name?<your_esp_identifier_or_hashed_email_name>=<value>domain.com/news/article_name?esp_id=2ncihj894y2jnjknfjsd",
    "Tracking growth": "Next, you can create an audience in Lytics to track the growth of profiles that have stitched a cookie to an email. An example of what this could look like in the Lytics audience builder is shown below: On the Audience Summary page, you can view how your audience of unknown to known users has grown over time. ",

    "Setup the audience": "In this example, you\u2019re going to send a personalized text message to a user when they become highly engaged determined byLytics behavioral scores. Additionally, you only want to send messages to non-subscribed users who have a phone number. Therefore, you are going to need to create an audience with three criteria. First, only users who are (or become) deeply engaged based on Lytics data-science scores. Second, their profile has a phone number. And third, they are not yet a subscriber as the text message will include a sign up link. In the audience builder, you're going to use anexisting audiencefor highly engaged users and twocustom rulesfor subscribers and phone numbers. For additional instructions on building audiences, check outthe audience builder docs. NOTE:Twilio's API requires phone numbers with a country code (e.g. +11234567890). If phone numbers are not stored in this format in the user's Lytics profile the cloud function can be used to correctly format the number. ",
    "Create the cloud function": "This example uses Google Cloud Functions to power this custom workflow, however this will work just as well with other serverless tools like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. For a quickstart on Google Cloud Functions seeQuickstart: Using the gcloud Command-Line Tool. The Lytics webhook sends the full profile of a user when they enter or exit the audience. The code below receives the profile in the body of the request, then uses the Twilio API to send a custom text message to the user. Note:You'll also need aTwilio account. When using a Twilio free trial, you can only send text messages to the numbers in yourVerified Phone Number list. Next, deploy the function.

Withing a few minutes you should begin to see some default web data flowing into theStreamssection of your Lytics account.",
    "Sending Additional Data to Lytics from within GTM": "Since GTM is a tag manager there are various approaches to sending data related to a users behavior, such as filling out a form or clicking a button, to any number oftagsmanaged by GTM. In the following section we'll cover the basics and give a few examples of common use cases but this is no way covers the gamut of what can be done to collect custom data. It is always best to refer to your account manager and the support team to get recommendations on solving specific data collection challenges. All of the following examples will assume you understand the basics of creating a newtagof typeCustom HTMLwithin GTM (steps 1 through 6 underInstalling the Latest Lytics Tag), just be sure to name the new tag(s) something descriptive and relative to the action being taken such as \"Pass form data to Lytics.\" In addition, for more information on collecting data with Lytics view our detailedJavaScriptdocumentation.",
    "Click Actions": "In order to track clicks with GTM we'll need to configure a newTrigger.From the side menu within GTM selectTriggers.ClickNewat the top right of the list of existing triggers.Name your trigger something descriptive like \"Clicked Picture of John Snow\".ClickTrigger Configuration.GTM has many pre-built triggers. For this example we'll use theAll Elementsoption underClick.Two additional options will appear. SelectSome Clicksso that we can trigger based on the click of a specific element on the page.In the firstselect menuthat appears we'll selectChoose Built-In Variable.This contains several pre-built helpers such as listening for clicks on an element with a particular class, ID, etc.For our example we'll assume our image of John Snow is implemented with the an id ofgameOfThronesas shown here:<img src=\"/john.png\" id=\"gameOfThrones\">SelectClick ID, which will allow us to trigger our tag only when a visitor clicks on elements with a specific ID.Change thecontainsmenu toequalsas we'll be expecting an exact match.In the empty space to the right of theequalsmenu typegameOfThronesor the ID that you are targeting.Save the trigger at the top right. Now that we have configured a trigger to listen for our specific action we can now tie that to a tag that sends Lytics information every time that action takes place. After you have created a newtagand selected type ofCustom HTMLwe'll configure the data sent and our trigger.In our example we are going to pass a simple event that sends context of what the user clicked but this could be expanded to be full featured and dynamic. Paste the following snippet into theHTMLtext area:HTML// the following script sends and event for a user stating they have clicked a particular ID<script>jstag.send({_e:\"clicked: gameOfThrones\"})</script>Under the *Triggeringmenu we'll then select our custom trigger we created in the initial steps.Save the tag and publish.",
    "Form Actions": "Note: When it comes to collecting form data using the built-in GTM helpers is a great place to start. However, it is always best to refer to your Engineering resources to ensure what is being collected is correct, secure, etc. This is merely an example of what can be done rather than the recommended approach. That very much will change based on your unique architecture and use case. Warning: Never collect/send secure data such as passwords, credit card numbers, etc. via this method. In order to collect form data with GTM we'll need to configure a newTrigger.From the side menu within GTM selectTriggers.ClickNewat the top right of the list of existing triggers.Name your trigger something descriptive like \"Submitted Fancy Form\".ClickTrigger Configuration.GTM has many pre-built triggers. For this example we'll use theForm Submissionoption underUser Engagement.Several additional options such as validation will appear. We will ignore those for this example but GTM offers a variety of helpers to ensure data collected is of high quality.SelectSome Formsso that we can only collect data from a specific form.In the firstselect menuthat appears we'll selectChoose Built-In Variable. This contains several pre-built helpers such as listening for clicks on an element with a particular class, ID, etc. For our example we'll assume our form has an id ofmyFancyForm.SelectForm ID, which will allow us to trigger our tag only when a visitor clicks on elements with a specific ID.Change thecontainsmenu toequalsas we'll be expecting an exact match.In the empty space to the right of theequalsmenu typemyFancyFormor the ID that you are targeting.Save the trigger at the top right. Now that we have configured a trigger to listen for our specific form submission we can now tie that to a tag that sends Lytics information every time that action takes place. After you have created a newtagand selected type ofCustom HTMLwe'll configure the data sent and our trigger.In our example we are going to pass along one of the inputs within the form with the namefirstName. Keep in mind that for your collected data to make it to user profiles the sent data must match what is mapped with LQL. Paste the following snippet into theHTMLtext area:HTML// the following script uses jquery to pull the specific value of an input with the name **firstName** within the **myFancyForm** form\n// this is a basic example and there are countless more detailed examples online of how to convert form inputs into JSON<script>jstag.send({firstName:$('#myFancyForm').find('input[name=\"firstName\"]').val()\n    })</script>Under theTriggeringmenu we'll then select our custom trigger we created in the initial steps.Save the tag and publish.",
    "Leveraging GTM Variables": "GTM variables are very useful and make the actual collection of data far simpler though they take a bit of work to configure. In our form example above, instead of using jQuery to get the actual value of inputs those values are already passed to the GTM data layer upon submit. By creating aVariablemapping of that input you can refer to the variable in your tag as opposed to writing more custom JavaScript. Google has somegreat documentationto get you started. Likewise, by searching on Google for things like \"collecting form data with GTM\" you will get some great step by step walk throughs on how to configure these variables.",
    "What is an \"event?\"": "In Lytics, an \"event\" is an action or activity performed by a user or a customer, such as visiting a website, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter. As pictured below, events are showcased as independent key/value pairs on a single data stream. Thesekeysare then translated intoFields & Mappingsin order to materialize to user profile for segmentation. ",
    "Exploring Data Streams": "Lytics will ingest data that is sent to one of Lytics' Collection APIs: the collect API or the bulk API. The bulk API is generally intended for larger imports of offline data, while the collect API is generally intended for more real-time sources and usage.",
    "Viewing Your Data Streams": "You can view information about your data streams in your Lytics dashboard by navigating toConductor>Pipeline>Streams. The primary purpose of this section is to verify that data is successfully being received by Lytics. If your account has multiple data streams, you can view a different stream from the dropdown menu above the graph. Many integrations have multiple streams. For instance, it is common for email integrations to have an activity stream and a user stream. Integration streams should be prefixed to help identify the source. You can find the streams for integration under the documentation for that integration.",
    "Event Ingress Graph": "The event ingress graph shows the number of events collected on a stream for the selected time period (past day, week, month, 3 months, and year)  and interval (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly). Above the graph, you will find the time the last message from this stream was received, the source of the data stream, and the number of fields in the stream. ",
    "Raw Keys Table": "Below the event ingress graph is the raw keys table. An event may contain any number of key-value pairs. Each record in this table represents a unique raw key seen on the stream in at least one event.  The table has the following information on keys: In addition to these seven columns, each record in the table can be clicked to open up a set of sample values. This can be used to verify that values are being collected and they match the expected data. The table can be filtered in three ways: used vs. unused, common vs. uncommon, and text search. Raw event keys can be hidden, but it is important to note that keys cannot be made visible again through the user interface - only through the API. It is recommended that a list is kept of hidden keys in the event one needs to be resurfaced at a later date. If you need assistance, please contactLytics Supportwith your key name and account ID. To hide a key: Select the checkbox next to the name of the key or keys.ClickRemove selected key.",
    "Final Thoughts": "Having logically differentiated data streams for different data sources also helps to facilitate a more straightforward process for mapping data from data sources to user profiles. However, integrating data from some data providers can make this distinction difficult.  For example, data routers like Segment or Rudderstack can route data from multiple sources into a single destination, like Lytics.",
    "Export Metrics to New Relic Insights": "You can choose to export incoming events metrics, audience change metrics, or user metrics to Insights for alerting and monitoring. Example: In Lytics, navigate to the New Relic integration in integrations.ClickExport Monitoring Metrics.Select the authorization you created in theauthorization step.In theNew Relic Account IDtextbox, enter the ID of your account. You can get this ID from the URL of \"Account Settings\" in New Relic.ClickStart Export. You should see metrics coming in as custom events into your Insights account after setting up this integration.",
    "Alerting Examples": "Once the export has started and some data has been collected on the New Relic side, you can use the data tocreate alerts within New Relic. For instance, using the LyticsMonitoring Heartbeat metric, you can create an alert if the service happens to be interrupted. The following alert(s) are just examples, Lytics recommend building in some buffers so alerts don't begin to go off for simple network issues. In this case we'll issue a warning if the query returns less than 1 for 5 minutes and a full alert if we see less than 1 for 15 minutes.  We could also create an alert to watch traffic collection which may tell us if there is an issue with the JavaScript tag on a production website. In this case if the value of collection counts falls below one, we know no data is coming into any stream so there is likely an issue. ",
    "Keep in Mind!": "Alerts can be configured for specific workflows, or for all workflows running in the account.Consider having one general alert to an Operations Channel or Team for all alerts, or alerts for specific workflows managed by particular teams Consider which statuses to includeAlerts can be configured for statuses aside from failures. Workflows like critical batch import workflows can send a confirmation on successful syncs as well. Understanding errorsIf a source or destination job has failed, Lytics will show the latest error message on the Conductor Diagnostics Dashboard and on the Logs tab of the Source/Destination Job Summary interface, and allow the job to be restarted if needed. The most detailed information for troubleshooting can be accessed from the Job Logs API.",

    "Import Custom Object": "Importing custom objects from Salesforce allows you to enrich Lytics profiles with sales and CRM data from your Salesforce account.  This will aid in targeting for your marketing efforts.",
    "Salesforce Administrator Setup": "You'll need to involve a Salesforce administrator when setting up the export. The administrator will need to perform the following setup: Set up aDuplicate Rulein Salesforce for leads (configuration pictured below).Set up the following Custom Fieldson the Salesforce \"Lead\" object: For \"Send Audiences To\"Field Type: Text Area (Long)Field Label: Lytics AudiencesField Length: 32,768 characters (32 KB)Field Visible Lines: 3Field Name: Lytics_AudiencesField Description: This user is a member of these Lytics AudiencesVisibility: Checked for all usersRead-Only: Not checked for any usersLayouts: Add to all availableOptional: For \"Send Content Affinity To\"Field Type: Text Area (Long)Field Label: Lytics Content AffinityField Length: 32,768 characters (32 KB)Field Visible Lines: 3Field Name: Lytics_Content_AffinityField Description: The top three kinds of content this user prefersVisibility: Checked for all usersRead-Only: Not checked for any usersLayouts: Add to all availableOptional: For \"Send Scores To\" (optional)Field Type: Text Area (Long)Field Label: Lytics ScoresField Length: 32,768 characters (32 KB)Field Visible Lines: 3Field Name: Lytics_ScoresField DescriptionVisibility: Checked for all usersRead-Only: Not checked for any usersLayouts: Add to all available ",
    "API Limitations": "Salesforce has limitations for the maximum number of daily API Calls. An API call is a connection made to a Salesforce server on your account's behalf. Lytics provides some guidelines below for working with these limits for your integration connection. Different accounts have different limits on the number of API calls allowed per 24 hours. You can find more information about these limits in theSalesforce documentation.In addition to your Lytics integration, your Sales team may have additional integrations using the Salesforce API. For example, they may use a tool to capture LinkedIn information and send it into Salesforce, which would also use their API. To estimate an appropriate number of API calls to enter for the Salesforce import, Lytics recommends you use the following formula: (Total Daily API Calls Allowed - Daily API Calls For Other Integrations) / 2 Dividing by two allows you to allot the same number of API calls to the upcoming Salesforce Export. To roughly estimate how long your initial import will take, use the following formula: (Total Leads + Total Contacts + Total Opportunities + Total Accounts) / Total Daily API Calls Allowed for Lytics Import This will yield the approximate number of days that will be required. Note: this estimate will be slightly low because each time the import encounters an API limit, it sleeps for 24 hours rather than restarting at the same time the following day.",

    "Monitoring": "Monitoring and alerting is available on every job and every authorization within Lytics. To set up alerting on your jobs or authorizations, you can set up a monitoring job from either the Job API or the Lytics UI for alerting toSlack,Microsoft Teams, or directly toemail. If a source or destination job has failed, Lytics will show the latest error message on the Conductor Diagnostics Dashboard and on the Logs tab of the Source/Destination Job Summary interface, and allow the job to be restarted if needed. The most detailed information for troubleshooting can be accessed from theJob Logs API Additional generic monitoring on the Lytics system is available on our status page atlytics.statuspage.io.",

    "Configure Your Sync:": "Now that the account is authorized, you can begin exporting or importing your users.",
    "Exporting Users": " In the export scenario, you\u2019ll click on the \u201cExport Audience\u201d button. From there, select the Brevo List that you want to import and the Lytics audience segment that you want to sync them into from the dropdowns.  You should also select the Email field. Finally, you'll want to map each Lytics field to a Brevo field.  By default, the advanced options are set to continuously import and to add users who already exist in the selected Lytics segment.  Finally, click on the \u201cComplete\u201d button located below the advanced options section.  Note: You can export segments by clicking on the Brevo tile within the Integration section of the Data menu tab (as demonstrated above). Alternatively, if you are within the Audience tab, you can also click on a specific segment and then click on the export button in the upper righthand corner to begin the export workflow.",
    "How to Use Collaborative Filter Engines": "The primary way to leverage Collaborative Filter Engines is through Recommendations. While Lytics' Recommendation API, and Experience toolkit allow you to deploy Recommendation campaigns onsite or via email, the Collaborative Filter UI allows you to experiment and test out Lytics' Recommendations. In theRecommendtab, you can fetch Recommendations for any user. Simply select the identifier field (_uidsin this case) and click on theRecommendbutton. This will request Recommendations for the selected user using the Lytics Recommendation API. The Recommended items are displayed below. TheItem Recommendationinput allows you to fetchsimilaritems for any given item. In the example below, we are finding items similar to the item withshopify_product_id = 631195017394. This can be used to find similar products based on user behavior.",
    "Creating a New Collaborative Filter Engine": "To create a new Collaborative Filter Engine, click on theNew Interest Enginebutton and click onCollaborative Filter. This will open a wizard with the following options. When creating a Collaborative Filter Engine, there are 4 fields: Name(required): the name of the new Collaborative Filter.Description(optional): a description for your Collaborative Filter.Inventory ID(required): the identifier associated with the items in your inventory (ie: an identifier from thecontenttable).Inventory Field(required): the field on theusertable that contains a user's activity (ie purchase history, browsing history, etc). This field must be a set or map type and must contain IDs referenced in theInventory IDfield. Once you create your new Collaborative Filter wizard, Lytics will train a Collaborative Filter model within minutes. Once the model has finished training, the UI will be available to use, as well as Lytics' Recommendation API.",
    "Machine Learning at Your Fingertips": "Creating aLookalike Modelis as simple as selecting aTargetandSourceaudience, to drive users from the source to the target (think [unknown --> known], [1-time purchaser --> repeat purchaser], etc). Once configured, Lytics will train a model based on the data accessible on user profiles, and output meaningful insights and predictions to help you grow your target audience. Some common use cases for Lookalike Models include: Unknown to Known: among my unknown users, find users who are likely to sign up for an emailExpand Reach: among my users who\u2019ve purchased one item, find users who are likely to become repeat purchasersChurn Prevention: find customers who are at risk of churning",
    "Built by Data Scientists, for Marketers": "Lytics' Lookalike Models incorporate modern techniques to ensure your models outperform traditional marketing methods. When building models, Lytics applies feature-reduction techniques and trains a set of Random Forests and Logistic Regression models, followed by a suite of model-tuning and cross-validation to determine the best configuration and hyper-parameters. Unlike traditional statistical modeling approaches, Lytics Lookalike Models update user scores in real-time, so you can start targeting users not only when the model is built, but also as their behavior changes or new users are added. This means that a prediction for a user will update after every event (ie: page click, email open) which helps ensure that you are targeting the best users. Rather than using a static list, predictive Audiences (Lookalike Audiences) built from Lookalike Models provide a dynamic pool of users that will respond best when they are ready for ads or other marketing messages. You can also adjust your targeting criteria to make the best tradeoffs between reach and accuracy to maximize your marketing budgets. Lytics also provides robust APIs for Lookalike Models, so your engineering team can quickly create and test models via the Lytics API.",
    "Present a Message Campaign": " The Present a Message campaign type is used to show any general purpose message to visitors. This could be used to broadcast sitewide promotions, mention in-store deals, or one of many other messages. Furthermore, the campaign can be configured to only a set of pages or a subset of your total audience. This allows you to limit the message from being seen on landing pages with highly focused calls to action, or to only users who meet the behavioral conditions for the message.",
    "Cookie Consent Management": "When it comes to managing cookie consent primarily on the client side, the common approach is to use explicit opt-out methods. One popular tool for cookie consent management is OneTrust. By utilizing OneTrust's cookie consent management, you can configure it to read the consent opt-out and prevent loading any configured tags. This means that the Lytics tag, responsible for sending data downstream and storing cookies client side, will be effectively disabled. To learn more about OneTrust's cookie consent management, visit their website:OneTrust Cookie Consent.",
    "Customer Consent Management with Lytics": "In addition to cookie consent management, Lytics offers a comprehensive platform for managing customer consent. Integrating Lytics with OneTrust can elevate your customer consent management to new heights. Lytics enables you to gather and handle customer consent data effectively, providing you with actionable insights and enabling personalized experiences while respecting consumer preferences. To learn how to leverage Lytics for managing customer consent, we have created a dedicated resource:Using Lytics to Manage Customer Consent. This guide will walk you through the process of utilizing Lytics alongside OneTrust to ensure compliance and build stronger customer relationships.",
    "Privacy Rights Automation": "As a consumer in California, you hold certain rights concerning your personal data, including the right to access and request the removal of information stored by companies. OneTrust offers efficient solutions for handling Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs), Data Erasure Requests, and automating privacy rights management. Data Subject Access Requests can be sent from OneTrust to the LyticsGet User API endpoint. This endpoint requires an API token to authorize the request and the by-field of the profile (typically email address). Any fields on the user profile can be returned and included in the reporting sent back to the consumer. Requesting the deletion of a consumer profile in Lytics can be triggered through the LyticsDelete User API endpoint. This endpoint again requires an API token to authorize the deletion request, as well as the email address (or other appropriate by-field) of the consumer profile to identify what to delete. This process returns a deletion request ID, which can be used to monitor the process completion. As the deletion involves removals from data archives anywhere else that the data may be retained, this can take up to 14 days in some cases. Here's an overview of how OneTrust handles DSARs: DSAR SubmissionOn your customer webpage, you can provide a URL link that directs users to a OneTrust-hosted web form dedicated to handling DSARs.This web form, residing on a dedicated subdomain, allows individuals to submit their DSAR requests by providing their email addresses and indicating their preference for information deletion.Request ProcessingOneTrust receives and queues DSAR requests, processing them in a systematic manner.Once a request is processed, the OneTrust system can perform the following actions:Submit deletion requests to Lytics and other connected systems and tools to ensure the removal of relevant information.Retrieve information from various configured connections, such as Lytics, CRMs, and databases, to generate comprehensive reports for compliance purposes.",
    "Integrating OneTrust with Lytics": "To further enhance your privacy rights automation and consent management, OneTrust allows you to configure a custom webhook integration with Lytics. This integration enables seamless communication between the two platforms and streamlines the following key functions: Delete ProfileEndpoints: The LyticsDelete User API endpointcan be used to send the profile deletion requests to Lytics from a OneTrust webhook.Required fields: The Delete User Endpoint requires a profile identifier or by-field that Lytics uses to identify the profile being deleted. When integrating with OneTrust for privacy management automation, it is recommended to use email as the identifier.API Key: Generated from the account settings in Lytics.Verify Deletion StatusThis step is optional but can be set up to check the status of profile deletion.The relevant endpoint and details can be found in the Lytics API Documentation for Profile Deletion.Retrieve ProfileEndpoint: The LyticsGet User API endpointallows you to retrieve profile information from Lytics and include it in the DSAR reports generated in OneTrust.Required fields: Similar to the delete profile configuration, the profile identifier or by field type and value should be specified (e.g., email).API Key: Generated from the account settings in Lytics.Optional fields: You can specify which fields you want to return when retrieving the profile information.",
    "Implementation Considerations:": "Implementing automation of consumer profile reporting and privacy regulation management should be done with careful consideration of the entire environment and systems which consumer data may be retained or synced from. Timing of syncs between systems, availability of complete data for reporting, and archive retention periods are all important to keep in mind when planning, designing, and implementing these types of automations.",
    "Defining a Global Stylesheet": "If you are planning to implement many web Experiences on your site, you will want to establish a stylesheet that will lay out the foundation for common CSS rules among them. It may help to generate an Experience or Pathfora config of each layout, and think about what you want to augment for each. The example JavaScript configuration in this guide includes a slideout, bar, gate, and modal widget to test against.    The stylesheet in this guide will be kept light, by simply adding a background image to all widgets and tweaking some colors and font styles and sizes of common widget elements. However as you can imagine, you can go even further to change any aspect of the widget including the size or positioning. For reference, thePathfora SDK documentationprovides a robust list of all of the class names of elements used in Pathfora widgets. Start by adding some general styles you would like to apply to all widgets.pf-widgetis the class name applied to the  highest leveldivelement of all Pathfora widgets.pf-widget-contentis the first child element. For slideouts, thepf-widget-contentis essentially wraps the same area aspf-widget. However for modal and gate style widgets,pf-widgetwraps the entire page with a background overlay whilepf-widget-contentcontains the modal content itself.  There's a problem though, widgets with the bar layout don't have apf-widget-contentdiv. So you can adjust the selector for the above styles as follows:  Next apply some additional styles to the call to action buttons.pf-widget-btnis the class name used on all Pathfora buttons, howeverpf-widget-okselects the first, primary CTA button. Lastly add some styles to match the color of the headline with the widget text, and minimize the size of the thewidget footer textwhen it is not being used.  These styles will cover future widgets you wish to build on the website. As you are building your own stylesheet, if you run into issues, while testing your CSS please refer to thetroubleshooting section.",
    "Widget Specific Styles": "Using the Experience Editor or the Pathfora SDK, you can define a custom class name for your widget. With this class name, you can style specific elements that are unique to that widget. Always preface your selector with thepf-widgetclass name to ensure that you don't accidentally effect other elements on your website: For a full in-depth example of specific widget styles, see theimage customization guide.",
    "Troubleshooting and Selector Specificity": "A common problem when writing CSS for Pathfora widgets is providing the correct level of specificity when selecting the element to style. If you've ever written a line of CSS and expected to see the change applied but didn't - this section is for you. The default CSS that the Pathfora library ships with is deliberately specific so that it is careful to not effect any other part of your website. The main side effect of this is that developers wishing to override the default styles must pay special attention to their selectors or employ the use of!importantto override the default styles of the library. Consider the following example using!important: The selector here is short and simple. However, because the the boldfont-weightis embedded in a deeper selector in the Pathfora base styles, you have to override it with!important. For reference, these is the relevant snippet of styles in the Pathfora CSS: Now consider how you would need to write this CSS without using!important: This is a ridiculously long selector! However the advantage is you no longer need to know which styles need to be overwritten with!important. Both techniques are valid and will result in the same changes to your widget. Feel free to use whatever method is easiest for you. Keep in mind if you are using SASS, LESS, or some other CSS pre-processor that allows for nested selectors, what would longer selectors may be easier to interpret. If you're not a fan of!important, continue reading for an in-depth look at how to easily derive the required level of specificity for your selector.",
    "Utilizing Chrome Developer Tools": "The best way to determine how to override a default style is to look the conflicting style from the CSS of the library. You can access the style sheet in thePathfora GitHub repositorywhich is open source, but it may be easier to debug your CSS using theInspect Elementfeature in Google Chrome developer tools.  Locate the relevant element in your widget by clicking on it while in the element selection mode in developer tools. You may also find it by navigating through the HTML source under theElementstab. Examine theStylestab for that element to see where the conflicting style is. Once you've located it, copy the selector and paste it in to your style sheet for modification. Then simply add the custom class of your widget accordingly to the selector: Add your rules, save your stylesheet, and test that the changes in the browser. Remember, you can always consult theLytics Support teamfor assistance when debugging CSS for your Web Personalize Experiences.",

For example, if you chooseAt least 50%, the Schema Audit will be filtered to include only user fields found on 50% or more of the profiles in your account.Data streamallows you to filter the Schema Audit based on the data source of a user field. Remember that a user field may receive data from multiple data streams.Search boxallows you to search for a specific user field by name.",
    "Interpreting Data Visualizations": "The visualizations near the top of the report tell you how user fields are used in your Lytics account. You can click on one of the visualizations to filter the table below.  The first pie chart shows the percentage of user fields that are providing data to build profiles from. In the example above, only 40% of user fields provide data to profiles. That means the other 60% of user fields have no data at all. This number should be as close to 100% as possible. The second pie chart shows the percentage of user fields that are being used to define audiences. In this example, 94% of user fields are not being used to define any audience.  This account probably mapped too much data, and could trim down their LQL quite a bit. The third pie chart shows how many user fields are merging data from multiple streams. A common example of merging data from multiple streams is anemailuser field. Typically, this may read data from your website as well as an email tool. One of Lytics' core competencies is merging data from different sources, so be sure to take advantage of this when creating your user fields. The distribution bar along the bottom of this section shows you what type of user fields are in your account. Certain types of user fields, especially any containingmap, are more expensive and should be used carefully. Mouse over the slices of the distribution bar to see how many user fields of each type are in your account.",
